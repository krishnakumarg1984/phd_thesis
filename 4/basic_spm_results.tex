In this  section, the performance  of the  basic \gls{spm} is  discussed through
simulation  and  by comparison  against  a  standard \gls{dfn}  benchmark  model
incorporating the full \gls{p2d} dynamics.

\subsection{Cell Parameters}
\input{4/cell_params_table}

\Cref{tbl:lcoSimParamsSPMp2d} lists  the simulation  parameters of  an \gls{lco}
cell  whose positive  and negative  electrodes are  \ch{LiCoO_2} and  \ch{LiC_6}
respectively. The electrolyte  in this system consists of \ch{LiPF_6}  salt in a
solution  of \gls{ec}/\gls{dmc}/\gls{emc}  in a  1:1:1 ratio.  The standard  set
of  \gls{dfn}  parameters have  been  extensively  described and  documented  in
literature.  In this  case,  the vast  majority  of electrochemical  parameters,
\viz{} the  geometric, thermodynamic,  kinetic and  transport properties  of the
cell  have  been  sourced from  Subramanian~\etal{}~\cite{Subramanian2009}.  The
significance  of  each  of  the  parameters in  the  context  of  the  modelling
assumptions discussed in~\cref{subsec:basicspmassumptions} is examined.

The simulation parameters that are applicable exclusively to the \gls{p2d} model
are shown with a shaded highlighting in~\cref{tbl:lcoSimParamsSPMp2d}. It can be
seen  that only  a subset  of the  isothermal \gls{dfn}  model's parameters  are
required  for the  the \gls{spm}.  In particular,  the~\gls{spm} has  five fewer
parameters  per  electrode. Furthermore,  all  six  physical parameters  of  the
separator  material required  in the  \gls{dfn} model  are ignored  in \gls{spm}
computations.  Neglecting  Arrhenius-type  temperature  dependence  of  physical
properties  and their  corresponding  activation energies,  the basic  \gls{spm}
facilitates  the ability  to  afford physics-based  modelling capabilities  with
\emph{sixteen} fewer parameters than  the equivalent isothermal \gls{p2d} model.
With the naive assumption of equal parametrisation effort per physical property,
this implies  a \SI{40}{\percent} reduction in  parametrisation requirements for
the basic \gls{spm} when compared to its \gls{dfn} counterpart.

Prima facie, it may seem that electrolyte porosities and filler volume fractions
do  not  influence the  \gls{spm}  model.  However,  they  do have  an  indirect
bearing  on arriving  at a  critical parameter,  \viz{} the  solid phase  volume
fraction, $\varepsilon_\sj$. This parameter is  required to compute the specific
interfacial  surface  area  of  the  electrodes  $a_\sj$,  \ie{}  the  effective
electrode area exposed  to reaction and is an important  entity in the \gls{spm}
model  equations  presented  in~\cref{subsec:basicspmgoverningeqns}.  The  solid
phase volume fractions are also required in simulating the \gls{p2d} model owing
to  the  need for  computing  the  effective  electronic conductivities  of  the
electrodes.\fxnote{cross-reference to  specifc newman equations here}.  They are
calculated as
\begin{equation}
\varepsilon_\sj = 1 - \varepsilon_j - \varepsilon_{\text{fi}_j}
\end{equation}
where $\varepsilon_j$  and $\varepsilon_{\text{fi}_j}$  are the  electrolyte and
filler  volume-fraction  within  the  respective electrode  regions.  Using  the
values from~\cref{tbl:lcoSimParamsSPMp2d} results in $\varepsilon_\spos = 0.590$
and  $\varepsilon_\sneg  =  0.482$  for the  positive  and  negative  electrodes
respectively. The specific interfacial surface areas are then calculated as
\begin{equation}
    a_\sj = \varepsilon_\sj \frac{4 \pi R_\pj^2}{\frac{4}{3} \pi R_\pj^3} = \frac{3\varepsilon_\sj}{R_\pj}
\end{equation}

As    discussed   in    the   assumptions    made   during    model   derivation
(see~\cref{subsec:basicspmassumptions})  and consistent  with the  assumed model
geometry,  the  parameters  not  covered  by  the  \gls{spm}  pertain  to  those
describing electrolyte dynamics and distribution  of electronic charge along the
axial  thickness  direction  of  the  cell. Properties  such  as  the  intrinsic
diffusivities  and conductivities  of  the electrolyte,  transference number  of
\ch{Li^+} in  the organic  solvent are thus  completely redundant  for \gls{spm}
simulation. The assumption of uniform charge density along the through-thickness
length of each electrode implies that the intrinsic electronic conductivities of
the two electrodes  do not play any  role in the model  dynamics. The porosities
and Bruggeman  coefficients in~\cref{tbl:lcoSimParamsSPMp2d} serve  as modifying
factors  of  the  intrinsic  conductivities  and  diffusivities  leading  to  an
effective value  within each  region of the  electrochemical layer.  Thus, their
relevance is also  rendered void in the case of  the basic \gls{spm} simulation.
The  thickness of  the  separator  material only  plays  a  role in  electrolyte
behaviour.  By the  model geometry  presented in~\cref{subsec:basicspmgeometry},
this parameter also falls outside the scope of the basic \gls{spm}.

The  thicknesses  of the  electrodes  are  optimised  for equal  loading,  \ie{}
to  achieve  a   balance  in  their  individual  capacities   to  store  \ch{Li}
atoms.  The thickness  of the  positive  electrode is  the chosen  as the  value
from~Subramanian~\etal{}~\cite{Subramanian2009}. The  thickness of  the negative
electrode region  is then  computed with  the goal of  equalising the  volume of
active material  in each electrode  for every  electrochemical layer in  a pouch
cell.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:basiccapacitybalance}
    A_{\text{elec}_\text{pos}}\varepsilon_\spos l_\text{pos} = A_{\text{elec}_\text{neg}}\varepsilon_\sneg l_\text{neg}
\end{equation}

In a  lithium-ion pouch cell, the  electrodes are designed such  that the layers
can be  overlaid on  top of  one another  and finally  encapsulated in  a pouch.
Geometrical considerations  then imply  that the  cross-sectional area  (or face
area) of the two electrodes must be  the same. However, due to the consideration
of  avoiding  plating  at  the  edges  due  to  microscopic  malformations,  the
design  is done  such as  to have  a small  overhang of  the negative  electrode
layer,  \approx\SI{2}{\milli  \meter} with  respect  to  the positive  electrode
layer\fxnote{citation  needed}  as  shown  in~\cref{fig:anodeoverhangpouchcell}.
However, the  active surface area, is  just the common overlap  area between the
two electrodes, and  thus, $A_\text{elec}$ is equal to  the cross-sectional area
of the positive electrode.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{placeholder_images/example-image-golden.pdf}
    \caption[Stacking of layers within a pouch cell]
    {Image showing the stacking of layers within a pouch cell. For the negative
        electrodes, there is a small overhang (\approx\SI{2}{mm}) at the
    edges with respect to the positive electrodes. This design choice
helps to avoid plating of lithium at the edges.}
    \label{fig:anodeoverhangpouchcell}
\end{figure}

Thus,~\cref{eq:basiccapacitybalance} reduces to
\begin{equation}
    \frac{l_\text{neg}}{l_\text{pos}} = \frac{\varepsilon_\text{pos}}{\varepsilon_\text{neg}} = 1.22
\end{equation}
yielding $l_\text{neg} = \SI{72}{\micro\meter}$.

At first, it  may be surprising to  note that the values of  the particle radius
$R_\pj$ used in  both the \gls{p2d} and \gls{spm} remain  identical. However, it
is important  to note that  the \gls{p2d} equations  of the \gls{dfn}  model are
cast in  a normalised  form, \ie{}  already set  up to  account for  the overall
capacity of the  cell under consideration implicitly through usage  of a current
density  (per unit  area) for  its  simulation. Furthermore,  this explains  why
increasing the  number of  discretisation nodes does  not increase  the modelled
capacity, but  instead serves to improves  the simulation accuracy owing  to the
enhanced spatial resolution.

The  overall  active  surface  area  $A  =  n  A_\text{elec}$  is  the  combined
cross-sectional  area  of all  layers  ($n$  is  the number  of  electrochemical
(pos,sep,neg) triplets) stacked  into the pouch cell. In both  the \gls{p2d} and
\gls{spm}  models, this  parameter serves  to  scale the  external load  current
down  to  the current  density  experienced  by  each electrochemical  layer.  A
value  of  \approx\SI{30}{\ampere \per  \meter  \squared}  was reported  in  the
results section of  Subramanian~\etal{}~\cite{Subramanian2009}. When considering
a \SI{60}{\ampere\hour} pouch cell with \SI{10}{\milli\meter} exterior thickness
and  using  the  parameters  reported  in~\cite{Subramanian2009},  this  results
in  a cross-sectional  area of  \SI{2.053}{\meter\squared}\fxnote{to add:  refer
to  layer  optimisation  chapter   for  detailed  derivation}.  Considering  the
equalisation of capacity  loading, with the newly chosen thickness  value of the
negative  electrode, the  1C-rate  capacity  of the  cell  has  been revised  to
\SI{29.23}{\ampere\per\meter\squared}.

On  simulating  the \gls{p2d}  model  with  a  trickle bleeding  type  discharge
corresponding   to   a  current   of   C/500   and   logging  the   data   every
\SI{1}{\milli\second}, after reaching \SI{2.7}{\volt}\footnote{From manufacturer
datasheets  for \protect{\gls{lco}}  chemistries,  this value  is considered  to
correspond to \SI{0}{\percent} \protect{\gls{soc}}.}, the remnant concentrations
in  the two  electrodes  were noted.  The  corresponding residual  stoichiometry
values  are reported  in~\cref{tbl:lcoSimParamsSPMp2d}  and  is consistent  with
typical values reported in literature for \gls{lco} chemistries.\fxnote{citation
needed here.}  This validation is  important, since below  certain stoichiometry
thresholds, the spinel/olivine  structure of the electrodes  can become unstable
and  collapse\fxnote{citation needed?}.  All other  physical properties,  \viz{}
stoichiometries  at \SI{100}{\percent},  maximum concentrations,  diffusivities,
reaction rate coefficients and \gls{ocp}  of the two electrodes remain invariant
between the \gls{p2d} and \gls{spm} models.

\subsection{Simulation Setup}

For  reproducibility of  results, it  is important  to discuss  the system-level
parameters influencing simulation setup.

The  lower cutoff  voltage of  the cell  is chosen  to be  \SI{2.5}{\volt}. This
is  deliberately  kept  lower  than  the voltage  corresponding  to  the  cell's
\SI{0}{\percent},  \ie{}  \SI{2.7}{\volt}.  If set  above  \SI{2.7}{\volt}  even
at  infinitesimally small  discharge  currents, the  cell  would cut-off  before
achieving complete discharge. Choosing a value lower than \SI{2.7}{V} means that
the cell gets a chance to recover its terminal voltage, despite spikes in highly
dynamic  load  currents  that  might  bring the  voltage  below  this  threshold
momentarily. If a low-enough value is  not chosen, a system-level shutdown shall
be  initiated  despite possessing  the  ability  to  continue to  operate  after
recovery  of terminal  voltage.  In  this case,  choosing  a  cutoff voltage  of
\SI{2.5}{\volt}  does  not  damage  the  cell  since  checks  are  in  place  to
monitor  the \gls{soc}  and  trigger cutoff  in the  event  of charge  depletion
(see~\cref{alg:ctstimespm,alg:disctimespm}).  Northrop~\etal~\cite{Northrop2011}
use this value, although no explanation is given for the choice.

The  upper  cutoff voltage  of  the  cell  is  chosen at  \SI{4.3}{\volt}  \ie{}
\approx\SI{100}{\milli  \volt}   higher  than   the  equilibrium   \gls{ocp}  at
\SI{100}{\percent} \gls{soc}. There are several  reasons for this smaller margin
at the upper end of the voltage spectrum:
\begin{description}[leftmargin=!,labelwidth=\widthof{\bfseries low
    probabilities},itemsep=1ex]
    \item[safety] li-ion cells are less tolerant to overcharging and can pose fire
        hazards
    \item[degradation] overcharging li-ion cells can lead to plating and
        accelerate other degradation mechanisms
    \item[low C-rates] charging C-rates are typically lower than discharge C-rates
    \item[CCCV charging] For on-board chargers, taper charging (such as in a \gls{cccv} profile) is
        activated, which ensures that charging
        current drops off rapidly, leading to a lower overvoltage towards the upper
        \gls{soc} range.
    \item[low probabilities] The only charging event when an electrified vehicle is in motion is during
        regenerative braking. The vehicular \gls{bms} manages the operating
        window such that the starting \gls{soc} is much lower than the
        overvoltage that could be caused due to braking. Furthermore, during
        operation, the net discharge events occur more frequently than
        regenerative braking events.
\end{description}

For  both the  \gls{p2d} model  and the  \gls{spm} model,  the cell  temperature
is   kept   constant   at   its   initial   value   of   \SI{25}{\degreeCelsius}
(\SI{298.15}{\kelvin}). This implies that the  operation of the lithium ion cell
is assumed  to be isothermal.  While this  is not true  in general, it  is worth
noting that thermal gradients in  the through-thickness direction is negligible.
\fxnote{citation needed} Furthermore, for  the C-rates considered (<5C), typical
in a \gls{bev} application and  for short-duration transient loads studied, this
is a reasonable assumption. Detailed modelling of thermal dynamics is not within
the scope of this thesis, as the primary goal is to obtain a physics based model
incorporating  electrochemical  principles  amenable for  embedded  application.
Future work could include \eg{} a lumped thermal model in both the \gls{spm} and
\gls{p2d} and compare their performances.
