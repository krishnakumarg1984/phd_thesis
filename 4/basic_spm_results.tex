In this  section, the performance  of the  basic \gls{spm} is  discussed through
simulation  and  by comparison  against  a  standard \gls{dfn}  benchmark  model
incorporating the full \gls{p2d} dynamics.

\subsection{Cell Parameters}
\input{4/cell_params_table}

\Cref{tbl:lcoSimParamsSPMp2d} lists  the simulation  parameters of  an \gls{lco}
cell  whose positive  and negative  electrodes are  \ch{LiCoO_2} and  \ch{LiC_6}
respectively.   The  electrolyte   in  this   system  consists   of  \ch{LiPF_6}
salt  in   a  solution  of   \gls{ec}/\gls{dmc}/\gls{emc}  in  a   1:1:1  ratio.
The  vast   majority  of  electrochemical  parameters,   \viz{}  the  geometric,
thermodynamic,  kinetic   and  transport  properties  have   been  sourced  from
Northrop~\etal{}~\cite{Northrop2011}.

The volume fraction of the electrode  and separator materials are computed as $1
-  \varepsilon_j  -  \varepsilon_{\text{fi}_j}$, where  $\varepsilon_j$  is  the
electrolyte-phase  volume fraction  within  each  of the  three  regions of  the
electrode.

In the interest of reproducibility of  results, the design decisions made by the
author on  a few important aspects  of setting up the  simulations are discussed
next.

\subsection{Simulation Setup}
The simulation parameters that are exclusively applicable to the \gls{p2d}
model are shaded in

The cells lower cutoff voltage is chosen to be \SI{2.5}{V}.
