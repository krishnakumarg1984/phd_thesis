Having performed a  comprehensive analysis of the state of  the art in \gls{spm}
modelling, this section presents the  author's unique contribution to the field.
Firstly, the  scope of the  contribution is identified. The  methodology adopted
and corresponding results are presented thereafter.

\subsection{Scope and motivation}\label{subsec:scopenewelectrolyte}

This subsection is intended as a capstone summary helping to briefly recount the
discussion so far  and to provide a  context for the author's work  in the wider
realm  of the  \gls{spm}  modelling art.  In  the same  vein  as the  discussion
in~\cref{sec:electrolyteinclusion}, the scope of the proposed enhancement to the
\gls{spm} concerns entirely  with improving the electrolyte subsystem  as it has
already been established in~\cref{subsec:simresultsbasicspm} that the simplified
representation of  the solid-phase subsystem  through a fourth  order polynomial
approximation method  for diffusion of  \ch{Li^0} in  the solid particle,  is of
sufficiently high accuracy.

Inspecting the  electrolyte domain,  the electrolyte  overpotential contribution
to  terminal  voltage   consists  of  a  diffusion   overpotential  in  addition
to   the  time-dependent   ohmic  losses   that  originates   from  differential
concentration  gradients  that  is   indirectly  dependent  upon  concentration.
Hence,  accurate  determination  of   spatio-temporal  concentration  takes  the
centre  stage.  For   the  computation  of  overpotential   in  the  electrolyte
phase,~\cref{eq:electrolytepdwithce}  proposed  by  Prada~\etal~\cite{Prada2012}
may be used.

There exists a  subtle detail in the  use of~\cref{eq:electrolytepdwithce} which
is discussed here upfront before proceeding  ahead to the refined context of the
author's  work.  The  intrinsic  conductivity  of  electrolyte,  $\kappa$  is  a
function of  the ionic concentration  (refer~\cref{subsec:basicspmsimsetup}). If
the ionic  concentration at  the corresponding current  collectors are  used for
$\kappa_\text{neg}$  and  $\kappa_\text{pos}$, this  would  lead  to a  lopsided
computation of the overpotential in electrolyte. Furthermore, under this scheme,
the computation of electrolyte conductivity shall be rendered ambiguous since it
is unclear which  separator interface shall be chosen for  the separator's ionic
concentration. Although this  has not been discussed clearly  in literature, the
author  of this  thesis chose  to use  the mean  concentration within  each cell
region, defined as
\begin{equation}
    \mean{c}_{\text{e},j}(t) = \frac{1}{l_j}\int_0^{l_j} c_{\text{e}_j}(z,t)\, dz = \frac{Q_{\text{e}_j}(t)}{\varepsilon_j l_j}
\end{equation}
although other measures  of central tendency might be equally  valid. Hence, the
results of this section have the associated variability in them depending on how
the electrolyte concentration computations are  used in evaluating the intrinsic
conductivity of electrolyte.

As  the  ionic  concentration  has  both  a  direct  and  indirect  contribution
in~\cref{eq:electrolytepdwithce}, its spatio-temporal  computation is a critical
aspect. As discussed  in~\cref{sec:quadraticapprox}, the quadratic approximation
is a widely used spatio-temporal model for electrolyte concentration which makes
the best  use of available physical  constraints. As established in  the results
of~\cref{subsec:quadraticsimresultsanalysis}, while  the spatial  performance of
the quadratic approximation approach is acceptable, its time-domain performance,
particularly at the crucial current collector locations is mediocre at best.

Thus,   the  \emph{scope}   of  the   author's  work   is  to   obtain  suitable
alternate   expressions   for   improving  the   computation   of   \textbf{time
evolution}  of  the electrolyte  concentration  whilst  retaining the  quadratic
approximation   approach   for  describing   its   spatial   profile.  Such   an
approach  is motivated  by  the  keen observation  that  the baseline  quadratic
approximation  model  has  a  natural  `pause'  in  its  model  description.  To
clarify,~\crefrange{eq:cecontinuitynegsep}{eq:Qepbyintegration}  form a  tightly
coupled set of  seven linear equations in seven unknowns.  The time evolution of
$Q_{\text{e}_j}$  are described  through  a system  of  first order  \glspl{ode}
given by~\crefrange{eq:negliionmolesquadratic}{eq:posliionmolesquadratic}.  In a
practical  implementation,  these  \glspl{ode}  are solved  independently  in  a
decoupled  manner,\ie{}  by using  the  coefficients  obtained from  the  linear
system of~\crefrange{eq:cecontinuitynegsep}{eq:Qepbyintegration} in the previous
time-step. The  author's hypothesis is that  by taking advantage of  the natural
break  in the  operational  sequence which  involves  two separate  computations
between  two independent  subsystems (for  all practical  purposes), it  must be
possible  to  replace  the  underperforming time-evolution  equations  from  the
baseline quadratic approximation with a superior alternate model.

\subsection{Methodology --- System identification}

This section presents the methodology adopted in obtaining an improved model for
the rate of evolution  of overall moles per unit area of  \ch{Li^+} ions in each
of the three regions of the cell.

\subsubsection*{Background}

This  section presents  the  background and  thought  process in  systematically
arriving  at  the  choice of  the  methodology  that  was  adopted for  the  new
time-evolution model of the electrolyte concentration.

Based  upon the  experience  gained  in dealing  with  the literature  presented
in~\cref{sec:electrolyteinclusion}, it is  the author's view that,  owing to the
complex behaviour of electrolyte, a  naive top-down approach \ie{} including all
the physics upfront  followed by a systematic simplification, might  result in a
model that is  mathematically intractable for adoption in  an embedded \gls{bms}
environment.  The baseline  quadratic  approximation method  has  proven that  a
bottom-up  approach, \ie{}  pre-assuming a  simplified structure  for the  final
model  and adapting  its coefficients  to physical  constraints yields  a viable
candidate for inclusion in the conventional \gls{spm}.

Upon  a   closer  examination   of  the  rubrics   of  the   baseline  quadratic
approximation  model, it  comes  to  light that  the  natural `pause'  discussed
towards  the  end  of~\cref{subsec:scopenewelectrolyte}  permeates  to  a  level
more  than  merely  having  to  operate  sequentially  on  two  pseudo-decoupled
subsystems  --- it  goes to  the extent  of rendering  the operating  philosophy
of  fitting  physical  equations  semi-void.   To  clarify  this  statement  and
to  substantiate   the  claim,  while  there   is  no  doubt  that   the  linear
algebraic   equations  of~\crefrange{eq:cecontinuitynegsep}{eq:Qepbyintegration}
do    incorporate    physical    principles   from    the    \gls{dfn}    model,
the     same     does     not      hold     true     for     the     \glspl{ode}
of~\crefrange{eq:negliionmolesquadratic}{eq:posliionmolesquadratic}.   In  fact,
all   the   boundary   conditions   from   the   \gls{dfn}   model   have   been
exhausted   by  this   stage  (refer~\cref{subsec:quadraticsimresultsanalysis}).
Although~\crefrange{eq:negliionmolesgen}{eq:posliionmolesgen}     are    derived
from     the      \gls{dfn}     model,      the     coefficients      of     the
diffusivities   in    the   \gls{rhs}   of    the   next   set    of   equations
\ie{}~\crefrange{eq:negliionmolesquadratic}{eq:posliionmolesquadratic},   merely
involve  substitutions  of the  spatial  derivatives  of the  assumed  quadratic
expression.

Herein lies the weakness of the  baseline quadratic approach. Unlike the spatial
algebraic equations, which are tightly bound by the continuity and flux boundary
conditions at the  separator interfaces, there is no equality  constraint on the
spatial  derivative, which  is free  to grow  or shrink  without any  explicitly
imposed  bounds.  The  onus  of  being accurate  is  therefore  on  the  spatial
derivative evaluation which in-turn depends  on the correctness of the quadratic
functions  (\crefrange{eq:cenquadreduced}{eq:cepquadreduced}) themselves.  It is
not feasible to quantify the magnitude of error introduced in the time-evolution
of concentration  given a small-signal  perturbation in the coefficients  of the
quadratic spatial  computation,\ie{} the implicit  coupling between them  is not
transparent. Since the quadratic approximation itself is not perfect, \ie{} does
not capture the  spatial gradient \emph{exactly} as the \gls{p2d}  model as seen
in~\cref{fig:spatialionicconc1C}, the internal coupling of coefficients leads to
errors in time-evolution computation.

The author's  approach is to  therefore break this detrimental  coupling between
spatial  derivative of  concentration  and its  temporal evolution  counterpart.
Inspired by the fact that the  quadratic approximation model almost achieved the
desired goals with
\begin{itemize}
    \item a bottoms-up approach, \ie{} assuming a model structure apriori, coupled with
    \item not bound by any physical considerations owing to exhaustion of equations
\end{itemize}
have  led  the  author  to  broach   a  modelling  concept  that  exhibit  these
common  traits,  yet completely  different  in  nature and  hitherto  unexplored
in  physics-based battery  modelling  in general  and  electrolyte modelling  in
particular --- \emph{black-box system identification}.

\subsubsection*{Brief introduction to system identification}\label{subsubsec:introsysid}

A complete introduction to the topic of system identification is well beyond the
scope of  this thesis.  However, keeping  in mind the  interests of  the battery
modelling community  who might not be  familiar with this subject  area, a brief
overview of the core ideas that  are essential for tackling the specific problem
at hand, is presented. For readers  further interested in this topic, the author
suggests  the  textbook by  Ljung~\cite{Ljung1999}  for  a thorough  theoretical
treatment of the foundation topics in system identification.

System identification aims  to provide a mathematical model  of the input-output
mapping  of  a system\footnote{The  precise  definition  of what  constitutes  a
`system' is given  in Ljung's textbook. However, for all  practical purposes, in
this thesis,  the word  `system' stands  for any  unknown entity  whose terminal
behavioural  model is  being  sought primarily  from  input-output data.}  under
consideration. The three categories of system identification are:

\item[White box] wherein underlying physical equations are completely known. The
numerical value  of coefficients of  governing equations are to  be parametrised
from input-output data.
