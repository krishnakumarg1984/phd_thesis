Battery modellers face the classic conundrum of conjuring physics-based battery models that remain amenable for control
applications. Firstly, the contrasting nature of this modelling objective is presented. Secondly, prior attempts by the
research community to tackle this issue is briefly examined. A suitable family of models from the broad category of
reduced-order models is identified as a promising candidate for implementation in controls applications. Next, the
drawbacks of this family of models is discussed in detail. The state of the art implementation for tackling these
drawbacks is presented and their inadequacies are discussed.

\todo{write the chapter first. Come back to summarize this.}
The following efforts/trials were done (failures)
\begin{itemize}
    \item first attempt
    \item second attempt
\end{itemize}
The following successes were achieved.
\begin{itemize}
    \item first attempt
    \item second attempt
\end{itemize}

At the end of this chapter, we have a control oriented reduced order battery model amenable for use in real-time
applications for SOC, SOH etc.\ estimations.
