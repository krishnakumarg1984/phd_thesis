% In  this  paper,  we  analyse  the computational  bottlenecks  in  the  existing
% modelling process  and propose a  significant improvement to the  DRA procedure.
% This paper is organized as follows. Our analysis reveals that the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of
% the large Block-Hankel matrix of the system\textquoteright s Markov
% parameters is a key inefficient step. In Section  2, analysis of a key step in the
% DRA, ie. the Singular Value Decomposition of a block-Hankel matrix (for choosing
% the model order)  is performed (bottleneck 1). An analytical  formulation of the
% massive computing requirements (storage and floating point operation counts) for
% replicating  the model  in Dr.  Lee's paper  (cite) is  given. Redundancies  and
% inefficiencies in  this step  are enumerated,  therby deeming  the computational
% requirements as unnecessary. Furthermore, another computationally demanding step
% in the DRA, viz. the linear algebra  operation for the computation of the system
% dynamics  matrix A\_hat  is  identified (bottleneck  2). In  Section  3, a  fast
% computational approach using powerful algorithms  is presented that slashes down
% both the memory and the floating point operation count of the CPU for bottleneck
% 1. The same code  is elegantly reused to arrive at a  solution for bottleneck 2,
% thereby promoting modularity.  In Section 4, the results arrived  at by applying
% the algorithms  of section 2  are presented, by  comparing them to  key internal
% variables from the existing DRA method. Furthermore, we compare and contrast the
% much  smaller  computational  requirements  of  our  proposed  method  with  the
% existing DRA  code for modelling the  cell behaviour. We show  that the existing
% Discrete-Time-Realization (DRA) algorithm can be significantly speeded up by our
% proposed methodology.

% A fast computational approach
% is presented that significantly reduces memory usage and CPU operation
% count by bypassing the redundant Block-Hankel matrix formation step.

% An attractive approach was
% proposed by Lee et al~\citep{LeeChemistruckPlett2012} using a technique
% known as Discrete-time-Realization Algorithm (DRA)~\citep{LeeChemistruckPlett2012a}.
% The ROM thus obtained in standard state-space representation can be
% simulated to obtain the evolution of electrochemical variables of
% the standard porous-electrode Li-ion battery model~\citep{DoyleFullerNewman1993,FullerDoyleNewman1994}.
% An unresolved issue of this approach is the high computation requirement
% associated with the DRA, which needs to be repeated multiple times
% for various SOCs and temperatures.

% Comparisons with existing DRA method highlight the significant reduction
% in computation time and memory usage as well as improved modelling
% accuracy of electrochemical quantities afforded by this new method.

% % In  this  paper,  we  analyse  the computational  bottlenecks  in  the  existing
% % modelling process  and propose a  significant improvement to the  DRA procedure.
