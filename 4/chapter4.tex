In  this  paper,  we  analyse  the computational  bottlenecks  in  the  existing
modelling process  and propose a  significant improvement to the  DRA procedure.
This paper is organized as follows. In Section  2, analysis of a key step in the
DRA, ie. the Singular Value Decomposition of a block-Hankel matrix (for choosing
the model order)  is performed (bottleneck 1). An analytical  formulation of the
massive computing requirements (storage and floating point operation counts) for
replicating  the model  in Dr.  Lee's paper  (cite) is  given. Redundancies  and
inefficiencies in  this step  are enumerated,  therby deeming  the computational
requirements as unnecessary. Furthermore, another computationally demanding step
in the DRA, viz. the linear algebra  operation for the computation of the system
dynamics  matrix A\_hat  is  identified (bottleneck  2). In  Section  3, a  fast
computational approach using powerful algorithms  is presented that slashes down
both the memory and the floating point operation count of the CPU for bottleneck
1. The same code  is elegantly reused to arrive at a  solution for bottleneck 2,
thereby promoting modularity.  In Section 4, the results arrived  at by applying
the algorithms  of section 2  are presented, by  comparing them to  key internal
variables from the existing DRA method. Furthermore, we compare and contrast the
much  smaller  computational  requirements  of  our  proposed  method  with  the
existing DRA  code for modelling the  cell behaviour. We show  that the existing
Discrete-Time-Realization (DRA) algorithm can be significantly speeded up by our
proposed methodology.
