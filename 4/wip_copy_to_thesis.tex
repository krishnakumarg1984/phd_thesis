\subsection{Customizations for Battery modelling}

Specific considerations are required for incorporating the Golyandina-Usevich
algorithm in the \gls{rom} workflow for Li-ion batteries. The classical
\gls{dra}architecture is set up to handle Single Input Multiple Output
(SIMO) systems, wherein all transfer functions are derived by considering
only a single input \textendash{} the applied battery current. Thus
the Markov parameters form a 2D matrix wherein each row corresponds
to individual battery transfer functions with columns representing
unit-pulse response samples for each transfer function. The 2D moving-window
illustrated in \cite{GolyandinaKorobeynikovShlemovEtAl2015} for
Block-Hankel matrix formulation has to be suitably reshaped to account
for this structure. Step-3 of the algorithm deals with 2-D FFT computation
of the Markov Parameter Matrix (MPM). In our implementation, this
is pre-computed as it remains invariant between iterations of the
Hankel-vector product computation loop. This pre-allocation and a
priori computation contributes to overall code efficiency.

Figure~\ref{improved_ROM_workflow} shows the \gls{rom} workflow with
the improved \gls{dra}wherein all computational bottlenecks highlighted
by shaded blocks in Figure~\ref{traditional_ROM_Workflow} have
been eliminated. The strategy is to first employ the (suitably modified)
Golyandina-Usevich algorithm for describing the matrix-vector multiplication
routines. These two functions are then used as inputs to the PROPACK
codes. Eigentriplets up to the desired upper bound on system order
is then computed using a Lanczos \gls{svd} iteration. Figure~\ref{svdcompare}
presents a comparison of singular values computed by both the  traditional
and new methodologies. It is evident that the two sets of singular
values are identical. Hence, this new scheme can serve as a drop-in
replacement for the classical \gls{dra}.

\section{Simulation Results and Discussion\label{sec:Results} }

In this section, I quantitatively demonstrate the reduced computational
demand of the improved \gls{dra}scheme by comparing it against the classical
\gls{dra}implementation. The physical parameters of the cell are the same
as those published in Doyle et al.\cite{FullerDoyleNewman1994}.
Table~\ref{table:simparams} lists the parameters used in the ROM
workflow, which are the same as those employed by Lee~et~al.\cite{LeeChemistruckPlett2012}.

\begin{figure}
	\caption{}
	\label{memory}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{memory} shows a comparison of the memory usage of
classical and improved \gls{dra}methods. It is evident that the \gls{svd} step
in classical \gls{dra}consumes an overwhelming majority of the total memory
demand, requiring approximately 100 GB for a Hankel block size of
8000. This can be a limiting factor in modelling slow cell dynamics
without access to a large memory workstation. The improved \gls{dra}method
eliminates this bottleneck and the memory usage of \gls{svd} step is trivial.
Overall memory usage of the improved \gls{dra}is dominated by Markov parameter
computation. Considering 10 GB of usable \gls{ram}, 60000 Markov parameters
(Hankel Block-size of 30000) can be captured.

Figure~\ref{cputime} shows a comparison of \gls{cpu} times for computing
the \gls{rom} at a single \gls{soc} and temperature for the classical and improved
\gls{dra}methods. Appendix \ref{sec:Specifications-of-Workstation} lists the specifications
of the workstation used for the computations. Owing to the high flop
count for \gls{svd} operation (eq.~\ref{eq:cpu_op_count}), the classical
\gls{dra}requires approximately 40 minutes for a Hankel block size of 8000.
Clearly, the overall \gls{cpu} time for classical \gls{dra}is almost exclusively
used in computing the \gls{svd}. The improved \gls{dra}method reduces the overall
computational time by two orders of magnitude, taking approximately
40 seconds for the same block-size. In this case, \gls{cpu} time is evenly
split between \gls{svd} and Markov parameters computations.

\begin{figure}
	\caption{}
	\label{cputime}
\end{figure}

From Figure~\ref{memory}, it is evident that if classical \gls{dra}
is employed, a standard laptop with a nominal 10 GB \gls{ram} limit (dedicated
for \gls{rom} workflow) cannot capture the full cell dynamics and hence
is restricted to 2500 Hankel blocks. This necessitates early truncation
of Markov parameters at 5000 seconds. From Figure~\ref{markov_cse_pos},
the truncation residue at 5000 seconds for the unit-pulse response
of solid surface concentration at positive current collector is $-0.0087 \text{ mol m}^{-\text{3}}$.
The truncation errors in the Markov Parameter Matrix directly translate
to errors in computed singular values, adversely affecting accuracy
of simulated cell variables. It must be noted that the accuracy of
simulation results reported here does not bear a causal relationship
to the particular \gls{dra}scheme employed. In-principle, when an upper
bound on computational usage has not been enforced, the numerical
operations of both the existing and proposed \gls{dra}schemes lead to similar
error magnitudes for the modelled quantities. Instead, the accuracy
comparison illustrated here primarily serves to demonstrate the practical
usefulness of the improved \gls{dra}scheme when implemented in a commonplace
computing environment.

\begin{figure}
	\caption{}
	\label{truncated}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{truncated} shows a comparison of singular values obtained
by the classical and improved \gls{svd} methods computed by imposing a \gls{ram}
limit of 10GB. Owing to early truncation of the Markov parameter matrix,
the dominant singular values computed by the conventional method differ
significantly from those computed by the improved \gls{svd} operating on
untruncated data. With the same memory constraints, the improved \gls{dra}
can handle up to 30000 Hankel blocks, allowing for capture of 60000
seconds of Markov parameter data.

For comparative analysis of modelling accuracy under this memory constraint,
a time-domain simulation of the ROMs obtained by classical and improved
\gls{dra}methods is performed. The input current profile corresponding
to UDDS drive cycle reported in Lee~et~al. \cite{LeeChemistruckPlett2012}
is used. Figure~\ref{time_domain_sim} depicts the time-evolution
of the solid surface concentration at the positive electrode/separator
boundary. For comparing the accuracy of the two ROMs, a COMSOL Multiphysics~\cite{Multiphysics2012}
simulation of the full-order pseudo-2D porous-electrode PDE model
is used as the reference. The \gls{rom} employing classical \gls{dra}diverges
over time, and after 1500 seconds results in an error of 1120$\text{ mol m}^{-\text{3}}$$.$
The \gls{rom} incorporating the new \gls{dra}workflow accurately tracks the COMSOL
simulation trend-line. Table~\ref{table:salientresults} provides
a summary of the key simulation results.

\section{Conclusions\label{sec:Conclusion}}
In this paper, Singular Value Decomposition of a large Block-Hankel
matrix is identified as a key bottleneck in the classical \gls{dra}for
reduced-order Li-ion cell modelling. An improved \gls{svd} scheme is presented,
which employs a combination of the Golyandina-Usevich and Lanczos
algorithms. The results discussed in Section \ref{sec:Results} demonstrate
the performance improvement achieved by the new method without trading-off
model fidelity. At a single operating point of \gls{soc} and temperature,
for a Hankel block size of 8000, \gls{rom} workflow incorporating the improved
\gls{dra}is approximately 100 times faster than that employing classical
DRA. Using the machine specifications in Appenndix  \ref{sec:Specifications-of-Workstation},
for 100 operating points (combinations of 10 \gls{soc} and temperature values),
computing the \gls{rom} requires only 6 hours using the improved \gls{dra}, whereas
the classical \gls{dra}consumes 666 hours (27 days). Furthermore, for the
same block-size, the improved \gls{dra}is demonstrated to be superior in
terms of memory efficiency, drastically reducing the memory requirement
from 112 GB down to 2 GB. Finally, the improved \gls{dra}demonstrates superior
modelling accuracy when implemented even in moderately equipped computing
environments such as laptops.

The proposed method leads to the possibility of modelling other physical
quantities in the cell geometry unhindered by computing limitations.
Furthermore, high sample-rate models to handle highly dynamic load
profiles can be deployed in future BMS applications. The scheme also
empowers the \gls{rom} framework to tackle cells with slower dynamics and
other chemistries with different rate-limiting mechanisms. The improved
\gls{dra}method opens up a wide range of possibilities and brings the goal
of physics-based battery model implementation in a high performance
real-time BMS a step closer to realization.
