This   chapter  presents   the   author's  attempts   towards   arriving  at   a
accurate  description  of  the  spatio-temporal  evolution  of  the  electrolyte
concentration. The  performance of the quadratic  approximation model introduced
in~\cref{ch:spmanalysis} is  thoroughly analysed  in the  context of  a symbolic
regression framework that  helped to expose the issue of  equation deficiency in
the underlying \gls{dfn} model. Although this framework did not ultimately yield
the  desired  outcomes,  it  did  facilitate a  comprehensive  analysis  of  the
strengths and weaknesses of the quadratic  approximation model which is not seen
in present literature.  Finally, the author's unique contribution to  the art of
single particle  modelling \viz{}  a novel  time-evolution model  of electrolyte
concentrations through  system identification is  presented. The results  of the
new approach  is compared  against the  baseline quadratic  approximation model.
Finally,  the novel  electrolyte time-evolution  model is  incorporated into  an
electrolyte-enhanced \gls{spm}  and the  performance of  the composite  model is
compared against the conventional \gls{spm},
