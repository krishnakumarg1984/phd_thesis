\capolettera{T}{his} chapter presents the  author's attempts towards arriving at
an  accurate description  of the  spatio-temporal evolution  of the  electrolyte
concentration. The  performance of the quadratic  approximation model introduced
in~\cref{ch:spmanalysis} is analysed through the novel application of a symbolic
regression framework that  helped to expose the issue of  equation deficiency in
the underlying \gls{dfn}  model for the purpose of electrolyte  modelling with a
pre-assumed model  structure. Although this  framework did not  ultimately yield
the desired outcomes, it did nevertheless facilitate a comprehensive analysis of
the strengths and weaknesses of the  quadratic approximation model which has not
been performed in existing literature. Next, the author's unique contribution to
the art  of single  particle modelling  \viz{} a  novel time-evolution  model of
electrolyte  concentrations through  the technique  of system  identification is
presented. The  results of  the new  approach is  compared against  the baseline
quadratic approximation model. Finally, the new model equations are incorporated
into  an electrolyte-enhanced  \gls{spm} and  the performance  of the  composite
model is compared against the conventional \gls{spm},
