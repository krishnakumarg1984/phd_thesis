* Scaled Newman Model with model equations
- list of symbols
- bode diags
- To remove color hyperlinking before printing
- xmpinclude (hyperxmp)
- binary tree 
- textsc for C-rate, especially uses like 1C
- cite colorbrewer2
- mendeley citation export is a problem. Switch to jabref if needed
- check citations especially since biblatex cleanup was very intrusive
- power input spm
- dropcap
- Black tombstone for sections

- enhanced spm paper
- enchanced spm with KF
- basic spm with FPF
- enhanced spm with FPF
- physics-informed eq circuit model
- scaling of newman model
- lionsimba as energy/power/resistance inputs
