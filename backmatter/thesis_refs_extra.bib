abstract = {The thermal behavior of a large-format lithium ion cell has been investigated during measurements on cell and battery level. High current discharges up to 300 A are the main topic of this study. This paper demonstrates that the temperature response to high current loads provides the possibility to investigate internal cell parameters and their inhomogeneity. In order to identify thermal response caused by internal cell processes, the heat input due to contact resistances has been minimized. The differences between the thermal footprint of a cell during cell and battery measurements are being addressed. The study presented here focuses on the investigation of thermal hot and cold spots as well as temperature gradients in a 50 Ah pouch cell. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the difference between charge and discharge can have significant influence on the thermal behavior of lithium ion cells. Moreover, the miscellaneous thermal characteristics of differently aged lithium ion cells highlight the possibility of an ex-situ non-destructive post-mortem-analysis, providing the possibility of a qualitative and quantitative characterization of inhomogeneous cell-aging. These investigations also generate excellent data for the validation and parameterization of electro-thermal cell models, predicting the distribution of temperature, current, potential, SOC and SOH inside large-format cells. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.

abstract ={Lithium ion batteries are increasingly important in large scale applications where thermal management is critical for safety and lifetime. Yet, the effect of different thermal boundary conditions on the performance and lifetime is still not fully understood. In this work, a two-dimensional electro-thermal model is developed to simulate cell performance and internal states under complex thermal boundary conditions. Attention was paid to model, not only the electrode stack but also the non-core components (e.g. tab weld points) and thermal boundaries, but also the experiments required to parameterize the thermal model, and the reversible heat generation. The model is comprehensively validated and the performance of tab and surface cooling strategies was evaluated across a wide range of operating conditions. Surface cooling was shown to keep the cell at a lower average temperature, but with a large thermal gradient for high C rates. Tab cooling provided much smaller thermal gradients but higher average temperatures caused by lower heat removing ability. The thermal resistance between the current collectors and tabs was found to be the most significant heat transfer bottleneck and efforts to improve this could have significant positive impacts on the performance of li-ion batteries considering the other advantages of tab cooling.},

abstract ={Infrared thermography shows that the joint between the cathode grid stack and the cell tab is a source of Joule heating within a lithium-ion pouch cell. This can exacerbate thermal gradients within the cell core if the C-rate is sufficiently high. This paper studies the heat generated at the cathode tab joint of a 14Ah lithium iron phosphate (LFP) pouch cell. The heat generation was quantified by using an energy balance equation and the average heat transfer coefficient was calculated by modeling the cell as an isothermal vertical plate in natural convection. The influence of this heat on the cell's thermal gradients was studied during a 3C and 8C rate of discharge. It has been found that removal of this heat at its source can appreciably lower the overall average surface temperature of the cell. However, at a 3C rate discharge, the removal of this heat can induce a greater thermal gradient within the cell core. At an 8C rate of discharge, there is a minimal improvement in the temperature gradient. As a result, a thermal management system which incorporates cathode tab heat removal would most likely be an ineffective design feature.},
