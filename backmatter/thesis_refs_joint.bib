abstract = {Increased driving range and enhanced fast charging capabilities are two immediate goals of transport electrifi cation. However, these are of competing nature, leading to increased energy and power demand respectively from the on-board battery pack. By fi ne-tuning the number of layers versus active electrode material of a lithium ion pouch cell, tailored designs targeting either of these goals can be obtained. Achieving this trade-off through iterative empirical testing of layer choices is expensive and often produces sub-optimal designs. This paper presents a model-based methodology for determining the optimal number of layers, maximising usable energy whilst satisfying specifi c acceleration and fast charging targets. The proposed methodology accounts for the critical need to avoid lithium plating during fast charging and searches for the optimal layer confi guration considering a range of thermal conditions. A numerical implementation of a cell model using a hybrid fi nite volume-spectral scheme is presented, wherein the model equations are suitably reformulated to directly accept power inputs, facilitating rapid and accurate searching of the layer design space. We show how thermal management design can limit vehicle driving range at high charging temperatures. We highlight how electrode materials exhibiting increased solid phase diffusion rates are as equally important for extended range as developing new materials with higher inherent capacity. We illustrate for a plug-in hybrid vehicle, how the proposed methodology facilitates common module design of battery packs, thereby reducing the cost of derivative vehicle models. To facilitate model based layer optimisation, we provide the open-source toolbox, BOLD (Battery Optimal Layer Design).},
