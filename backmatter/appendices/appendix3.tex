This thesis was created using \LaTeXe{} and Bib\LaTeX{}/Biber wherein the source
code was edited in neovim using the vimtex plugin. The typesetting engine  is
\StrBehind{\luatexbanner}{\detokenize{This is}}{}. The body copy is set in a
12pt~Libertinus Serif text with the section headers set in Libertinus Sans. A
value of 1.618 (golden ratio) is used as the spacing factor between baselines
in the body copy. Source code listings are set in 9pt~Latin Modern Mono.
