\chapter{Introduction}\label{ch:intro}

More introductory material goes here blah blah \dots \dots

In  recent  years,  tightening  emissions  regulations  for  various  industrial
sectors  have  forced   a  renewed  interest  in   sustainable  energy  sources.
The   demand  for   clean  energy   has  led   the  automotive,   utilities  and
consumer  electronics   industries  to  develop  advanced   methods  of  storing
energy~\cite{Weiss2011}.  Li-ion   batteries  are   seen  as  key   enablers  in
this  quest  due   to  the  attractiveness  of  their  high   energy  and  power
densities   relative  to   other  competing   non-conventional  energy   storage
technologies~\cite{Ibrahim2008}.  However, with  this  increased energy  storage
demands  comes  a stricter  requirement  for  cell longevity,  performance,  and
adhesion  to  safety  requirements,  particularly  for  adoption  in  mainstream
transport  electrification~\cite{Andrea2010}.  Lithium-ion  cells  have  several
advantages over other competing cell  chemistries including high energy density,
long lifecycles, low  internal resistance, low self-discharge,  long cycle life,
fast charge  and discharge cycles~\cite{Reddy2011,Plett2015}. This  makes it the
preferred choice for  energy storage and on-demand retrieval  in modern consumer
electronics and~\glspl{xeV}.


\section{Chemistry}\label{subsec:liionchemistry}

This section  provides a  brief overview of  the essential  chemistry principles
that helps to provide a background context for the governing equations presented
in~\cref{subsec:basicspmgoverningeqns}.


In  a Li-ion  cell,  the  positive electrode  consists  of  porous particles  of
Lithium-Transition Metal Oxide (MO)  compounds. The negative electrode typically
employs  some  variant  of  microporous  graphite.  The  porous  nature  of  the
electrodes provide pathways for lithium  ion conduction through the electrolyte.
Due  to  the  special  construction  of the  electrode  structure,  there  exist
interstitial  sites  which act  as  intercalation  spots for  Lithium  shuttling
between the two  electrodes. The electrolyte, whose dynamics are  ignored in the
\gls{spm}, helps  in the  conduction of \ch{Li^+}  ions. The  separator membrane
allows  the passage  of  these ions  between the  two  electrodes, but  prevents
internal  short-circuit  by inhibiting  electronic  conduction  through it.  The
current collectors facilitate  passage of electrons generated  during the charge
transfer reaction  at particle surface  to the  external circuit. With  the help
of~\cref{fig:chargetransferprocess}  the  steps  involved  in  this  process  is
detailed next.

    process and illustration of basic working mechanism of a Li-ion cell.}
    \label{fig:chargetransferprocess}
\end{figure}

At fully  charged condition,  the majority  of Lithium in  the system  is stored
within  the  negative  electrode  microstructure.  During  discharge,  \ch{Li^0}
atoms  diffuse  out of  deep  interstitial  sites  towards  the surface  of  the
particles  in  the negative  electrode.  At  the surface  (electrode-electrolyte
interface),  a charge-transfer  process takes  place according  to Butler-Volmer
kinetics~\cref{eq:butlervolmer}, leading to the  formation of \ch{Li^+} ions and
electrons.  The electrons  are passed  to the  external circuit  through \ch{Cu}
current collectors  onto which  the conductive matrix  composed of  the negative
electrode material and binders is coated.  The \ch{Li^+} ions travel through the
electrolyte phase,  crossing the  separator membrane  to the  positive electrode
where they  encounter an  electron influx  from the  external circuit.  A charge
transfer  reaction  takes  place  at  the  surface  of  the  positive  electrode
particles, leading to the formation of neutral \ch{Li^0} atoms that diffuse into
the positive electrode microstructure.

During  the   charging  process,  the   reverse  phenomena  occur.   Lithium  is
de-intercalated  from  the  positive  electrode and  a  similar  charge-transfer
happens  at the  surface,  leading  to the  formation  of  \ch{Li^+} ions  which
reach  the  negative  electrode  by   passing  through  the  separator.  At  the
surface  of  the  negative  electrode particles,  these  ions  absorb  electrons
from  the  external circuit,  leading  to  the  formation of  neutral  \ch{Li^0}
that   diffuses  into   interior   vacant  spaces   in   the  layered   graphite
electrode. The  charge-transfer mechanism  and sequence  of events  are depicted
in~\cref{fig:chargetransferprocess}.
\Cref{eq:NegElectrodeRxn,eq:PosElectrodeRxn} summarise the reactions during the
charging and discharging process at the surfaces of both electrode materials.
\begin{align}
    \ch{Li_{$x$} C                            &<=>[\tiny{discharge}][\tiny{charge}] C + $x$ Li^+ + $x$ e^-}\label{eq:NegElectrodeRxn}\\
    \ch{Li_{1-$x$} M O2 + $x$ Li^+  + $x$ e^- &<=>[\tiny{discharge}][\tiny{charge}] LiMO2}\label{eq:PosElectrodeRxn}
\end{align}
where    \ch{M}   represents    a    transition   metal    compound   such    as
\ch{Ni_{1/3}Co_{1/3}Mn_{1/3}}   (NMC),   \ch{Ni_{0.8}Co_{0.15}Al_{0.05}}   (NCA)
amongst other  choices~\cite{Reddy2011}. Assuming  no loss of  cycleable Lithium
due to  parasitic side  reactions or  through other  mechanisms, the  process is
fully reversible.


The electrochemical potential at each electrode  is dependent upon the extent of
its  lithiation. An  empirical  relationship of  each  electrode's potential  as
a  function  of  its  stoichiometry  can be  obtained,  and  is  dependent  upon
the  specific design  and  material  properties of  each  active material  under
consideration. Finally, the \gls{ocv} of the cell is obtained by subtracting the
negative electrode potential from its positive electrode counterpart.


\section{Battery Modelling}

Through accurate model representations  of the electrochemical-thermal behaviour
of  the cell,  advanced monitoring  and control  strategies can  be deployed  to
tackle  the current  research  topics  in Li-ion  batteries  such as  increasing
cycle-life, improving operational  safety and performance~\cite{Plett2015}. Over
the past  two decades, efforts  have been made  to construct accurate  models to
describe  the physical,  electrical, thermal,  electrochemical and  system-level
performance  of  Li-ion  cells,  leading  to  modelling  strategies  of  various
level  of  sophistication.  For  the  interested  reader,  large  in-roads  into
understanding  the breadth  and  depth  of modelling  of  lithium ion  batteries
can  be  made   from  perusing  comprehensive  books  on  this   topic  such  as
those  by Plett~\cite{Plett2015},  Hariharan~\cite{Hariharan2017}, and  Rahn and
Wang~\cite{Rahn2013}.

The  need to  address the  challenges of  lithium ion  batteries in  an embedded
environment such as on-board an electric vehicle has led to an increased impetus
on  the development  of advanced  \glspl{bms}~\cite{Bergveld2002}. In  vehicular
applications,  the only  measurable quantities  of a  lithium ion  cell are  its
terminal voltage,  current and temperature.  This implies that  several internal
states of the  cell such as its \gls{soc}, whose  real-time computation is vital
to  the  optimal performance  of  the  cell, need  to  be  estimated from  these
available measurements. Therefore, the performance of a \gls{bms} for tasks such
as online state estimation is dependent upon the fidelity of the underlying cell
model  used. Sophisticated  models of  the cell  enable these  quantities to  be
estimated more accurately and facilitate  the implementation of advanced control
algorithms. Therefore, it is imperative that the cell model used is suitable for
being embedded in a real-time \gls{bms}.

Most battery  models have the primary  goal of accurately predicting  the cell's
terminal  voltage  at each  time-step.  This  is so  that  the  output from  the
predictor routine  can be compared  to the  measured voltage and  the difference
between them  may be used in  a suitable corrector-subroutine to  improve future
prediction.  The combined  information from  the model  and measurement  is then
blended in a suitable way to estimate the cell's \gls{soc}.

More   advanced  models   strive   to  provide   insight   into  various   other
physico-chemical quantities  that could  affect the health  of the  battery. The
field of  Li-ion battery modelling can  be classified into two  broad categories
---
\begin{enumerate*}[label=\roman*)]
    \item empirical/ad-hoc \glspl{ecm}, and
    \item detailed  \glspl{pbm} that are based  upon first principles.
\end{enumerate*}
However, these  two approaches are typically  at loggerheads with each  other in
the aspect of their computational complexity.

\subsection{\glsfmtlong{ecm}s}

\glspl{ecm}  employ circuit  elements  such as  voltage  sources, resistors  and
capacitors to  model the behaviour  of batteries at their  electrical terminals.
The cell's  thermal subsystem may  also be  modelled by an  analogous electrical
circuit. The  parameters of the  circuit are  typically functions of  the cell's
current, \gls{soc} and  temperature and can be implemented as  a lookup table by
curve-fitting  the model  to experimental  data. Using  such equivalent  circuit
models, two simple methods are available to compute the cell's \gls{soc} ---
\begin{enumerate*}[label=\itshape\alph*\upshape)]
    \item manufacturer-supplied  lookup table or graph of \gls{ocv} versus \gls{soc}, and
    \item numerically integrating the charge passed in and out of the cell over time, commonly referred to as coulomb counting.
\end{enumerate*}
Both methods are computationally  amenable for small-scale embedded applications
like  consumer  electronics;  however,  neither  one is  robust  to  handle  the
stringent demands in performance imposed  by modern vehicular applications.

Advanced state estimation algorithms such  as nonlinear Kalman filters may still
be able to use \glspl{ecm} as the plant model and obtain reasonable estimates of
the  cell's  \gls{soc}~\cite{Plett2006,  Sun2011}. However,  the  usefulness  of
\glspl{ecm} is limited by the fact that their parameters are derived essentially
by a  curve-fitting process using a  standard set of training  data. Since these
models are  not based on  any physical phenomena,  their ability to  predict the
cell's general behaviour  is extremely poor especially when  subjects to current
profiles well  outside their training  realm. Another important  disadvantage of
equivalent circuit  models is that they  do not allow insights  into the various
internal states of the cell.

\glspl{ecm}s  of  lithium  ion  batteries  have  been  extensively  studied  and
are  widely  applied.  However,  the aforementioned  difficulties  render  their
reliability and  accuracy questionable,  especially under highly  demanding load
profiles  experienced by  the battery  packs in  \glspl{xeV}. The  boundaries of
their  performance have  been well-quantified  (see~\cite{Plett2015,Plett2016}).
Although  various estimation  and control  algorithms continue  to be  developed
around them, the  \glspl{ecm} themselves are no longer the  subject of extensive
research. Hence, this thesis does not discuss them further.

\subsection{\glsfmtlong{pbm}s}

Physics-based  models  employ governing  equations  that  construct an  accurate
realization  of  the   behaviour  of  the  system  based   on  first  principles
of   electrochemical   thermodynamics   and   kinetics.   Doyle,   Fuller,   and
Newman  {[}cite{]}   developed  a  porous   electrode  model  to   describe  the
cells\textquoteright{} internal variables like  solid and electrolyte potential,
solid  and   electrolyte  concentrations,   and  lithium  molar   flux  density,
respectively. The fundamental  advantage to this modelling approach  is that the
prediction  of the  internal variables  can  be obtained  for arbitrary  current
profiles, whereas the  error of the equivalent circuit models  is very high when
current profiles outside  the model\textquoteright s training  realm is applied.
Also, direct estimation  of state-of-charge and cell-capacity  is obtained using
the  Physics-based  model {[}cite{]}.  The  difficulty  with the  physics  based
modelling  approach is  to obtain  the values  of all  the physical,  geometric,
electrochemical, thermal  and kinetic  parameters of  the cells.  Usually, these
parameters are  trade secrets of various  cell manufacturers, and varies  due to
production spread.  Only a  limited number  of cell  parameters can  be obtained
directly from laboratory experiments. Hence,  some sort of system identification
method needs to be employed for extrapolating other cell parameters. Also, it is
a common practice to rely on published data for estimating certain parameters of
the cell that do not depend  on physical construction, especially for those that
remain universally  true for a particular  Li-ion family of cell  chemistry. The
disadvantage of physics-based models is that their simulation is time-consuming,
requiring  sophisticated  multi-physics  PDE  solvers and  hence  not  typically
suitable for  embedded applications. However, for  high performance applications
like automotive battery management  systems where the state-of-health monitoring
is crucial,  there is an overwhelming  demand for the insight  into the internal
cell variables. Thus, applying various model order reduction technqiues are seen
a key enabler in porting the predictive powers of the physics-based model into a
real-time microprocessor.

This  thesis  strives to  represent  all  physical  quantities in  the  standard
International  System  of Units  (SI-Units).  However,  there are  some  notable
exceptions \eg{} for the capacity of a  Li-ion cell, which is represented in the
practical units  of Ampere  hours (\SI{}Ah),  rather than the  base SI  Units of
Coulombs (\SI{}{\coulomb}).  Such exceptions  are made  taking into  account the
prevalent conventions in standard literature.
