abstract = {To guarantee the safety, high efficiency and long lifetime for lithium-ion battery, an advanced battery management system requires a physics-meaningful yet computationally efficient battery model. The pseudo-two dimensional (P2D) electrochemical model can provide physical information about the lithium concentration and potential distributions across the cell dimension. However, the extensive computation burden caused by the temporal and spatial discretization limits its real-time application. In this research, we propose a new simplified electrochemical model (SEM) by modifying the boundary conditions for electrolyte diffusion equations, which significantly facilitates the analytical solving process. Then to obtain a reduced order transfer function, the Pad{\'{e}} approximation method is adopted to simplify the derived transcendental impedance solution. The proposed model with the reduced order transfer function can be briefly computable and preserve physical meanings through the presence of parameters such as the solid/electrolyte diffusion coefficients (Ds{\&}De) and particle radius. The simulation illustrates that the proposed simplified model maintains high accuracy for electrolyte phase concentration (Ce) predictions, saying 0.8{\%} and 0.24{\%} modeling error respectively, when compared to the rigorous model under 1C-rate pulse charge/discharge and urban dynamometer driving schedule (UDDS) profiles. Meanwhile, this simplified model yields significantly reduced computational burden, which benefits its real-time application.},

abstract = {The design of predictive, electrochemical, Li-ion battery models and the use of model-order reduction techniques to extract low-order models enables researchers to address problems related to model-based control, estimation, aging, and life-cycle prediction. This paper presents a novel approach to the design and parametrization of a reduced-order model characterizing the dynamic voltage response of a Li-ion cell. The model is based on the assumption of uniform active material utilization and includes prediction of the ionic concentration and potential dynamics in the liquid phase, which significantly affects the voltage response for high currents. A model-order reduction procedure based on the Pade approximation method is used to reduce the partial differential equation model to a low-order system of ordinary differential equations. Systematic methods are proposed to identify the electrochemical parameters that govern power and capacity prediction, as well as their temperature dependence. The procedure is based on carefully designed experiments that isolate the influence of small groups of parameters on the voltage output, utilizing complete cell data for model identification almost entirely in place of half-cell characterization. Finally, an extensive validation with experimental data illustrates the ability of the model to accurately predict the cell voltage.},

abstract = {The electrochemistry-based battery model can provide physics-meaningful knowledge about the lithium-ion battery system with extensive computation burdens. To motivate the development of reduced order battery model, three major contributions have been made throughout this paper: (1) the transfer function type of simplified electrochemical model is proposed to address the current-voltage relationship with Pad{\'{e}} approximation method and modified boundary conditions for electrolyte diffusion equations. The model performance has been verified under pulse charge/discharge and dynamic stress test (DST) profiles with the standard derivation less than 0.021 V and the runtime 50 times faster. (2) the parametric relationship between the equivalent circuit model and simplified electrochemical model has been established, which will enhance the comprehension level of two models with more in-depth physical significance and provide new methods for electrochemical model parameter estimation. (3) four simplified electrochemical model parameters: equivalent resistance Req, effective diffusion coefficient in electrolyte phase Deeff, electrolyte phase volume fraction $\epsilon$ and open circuit voltage (OCV), have been identified by the recursive least square (RLS) algorithm with the modified DST profiles under 45, 25 and 0 °C. The simulation results indicate that the proposed model coupled with RLS algorithm can achieve high accuracy for electrochemical parameter identification in dynamic scenarios.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a novel parameter identification method for the lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery equivalent circuit model (ECM) considering the electrochemical properties. An improved pseudo two-dimension (P2D) model is established on basis of partial differential equations (PDEs), since the electrolyte potential is simplified from the nonlinear to linear expression while terminal voltage can be divided into the electrolyte potential, open circuit voltage (OCV), overpotential of electrodes, internal resistance drop, and so on. The model order reduction process is implemented by the simplification of the PDEs using the Laplace transform, inverse Laplace transform, Pade approximation, etc. A unified second order transfer function between cell voltage and current is obtained for the comparability with that of ECM. The final objective is to obtain the relationship between the ECM resistances/capacitances and electrochemical parameters such that in various conditions, ECM precision could be improved regarding integration of battery interior properties for further applications, e.g., SOC estimation. Finally simulation and experimental results prove the correctness and validity of the proposed methodology.},

@article{Jokar2016,
abstract = {Over the last decade, many efforts have been deployed to develop models for the prediction, the control, the optimization and the parameter estimation of Lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries. It appears that the most successful electrochemical-based model for Li-ion battery is the Pseudo-two-Dimensional model (P2D). Due to the fact that the governing equations are complex, this model cannot be used in real-time applications like Battery Management Systems (BMSs). To remedy the situation, several investigations have been carried out to simplify the P2D model. Mathematical and physical techniques are employed to reduce the order of magnitude of the P2D governing equations. The present paper is a review of the studies on the modeling of Li-ion batteries with simplified P2D models. The assumptions on which these models rest are stated, the calculation methods are examined, the advantages and the drawbacks of the models are discussed and their applications are presented. Suggestions for overcoming the shortcomings of the models are made. Challenges and future directions in the modeling of Li-ion batteries are also discussed.},

abstract = {Robust algorithms using reduced order equivalent circuit model (ECM) for an accurate and reliable estimation of battery states in various applications become more popular. In this study, a novel adaptive, self-learning heuristic algorithm for on-board impedance parameters and voltage estimation of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) in electric vehicles is introduced. The presented approach is verified using LIBs with different composition of chemistries (NMC/C, NMC/LTO, LFP/C) at different aging states. An impedance-based reduced order ECM incorporating ohmic resistance and a combination of a constant phase element and a resistance (so-called ZARC-element) is employed. Existing algorithms in vehicles are much more limited in the complexity of the ECMs. The algorithm is validated using seven day real vehicle data with high temperature variation including very low temperatures (from −20 °C to +30 °C) at different Depth-of-Discharges (DoDs). Two possibilities to approximate both ZARC-elements with finite number of RC-elements on-board are shown and the results of the voltage estimation are compared. Moreover, the current dependence of the charge-transfer resistance is considered by employing Butler–Volmer equation. Achieved results indicate that both models yield almost the same grade of accuracy.},

abstract = {Lithium ion (Li-ion) batteries provide high energy and power density energy storage for diverse applications ranging from cell phones to hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs). For efficient and reliable systems integration, low order dynamic battery models are needed. This paper introduces a general method to generate numerically a fully observable/controllable state variable model from electrochemical kinetic, species and charge partial differential equations that govern the discharge/charge behavior of a Li-ion battery. Validated against a 313th order nonlinear CFD model of a 6Ah HEV cell, a 12th order state variable model predicts terminal voltage to within 1{\%} for pulse and constant current profiles at rates up to 50C. The state equation is constructed in modal form with constant negative real eigenvalues distributed in frequency space from 0 to 10Hz. Open circuit potential, electrode surface concentration/reaction distribution coupling and electrolyte concentration/ionic conductivity nonlinearities are explicitly approximated in the model output equation on a local, electrode-averaged and distributed basis, respectively. The balanced realization controllability/observability gramian indicates that the fast electrode surface concentration dynamics are more observable/controllable than the electrode bulk concentration dynamics (i.e. state of charge).},

abstract = {Accurate diagnosis of lithium ion battery state-of-health (SOH) is of significant value for many applications, to improve performance, extend life and increase safety. However, in-situ or in-operando diagnosis of SOH often requires robust models. There are many models available however these often require expensive-to-measure ex-situ parameters and/or contain unmeasurable parameters that were fitted/assumed. In this work, we have developed a new empirically parameterised physics-informed equivalent circuit model. Its modular construction and low-cost parametrisation requirements allow end users to parameterise cells quickly and easily. The model is accurate to 19.6 mV for dynamic loads without any global fitting/optimisation, only that of the individual elements. The consequences of various degradation mechanisms are simulated, and the impact of a degraded cell on pack performance is explored, validated by comparison with experiment. Results show that an aged cell in a parallel pack does not have a noticeable effect on the available capacity of other cells in the pack. The model shows that cells perform better when electrodes are more porous towards the separator and have a uniform particle size distribution, validated by comparison with published data. The model is provided with this publication for readers to use.},
