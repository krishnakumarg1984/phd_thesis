abstract = {Over the last decade, many efforts have been deployed to develop models for the prediction, the control, the optimization and the parameter estimation of Lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries. It appears that the most successful electrochemical-based model for Li-ion battery is the Pseudo-two-Dimensional model (P2D). Due to the fact that the governing equations are complex, this model cannot be used in real-time applications like Battery Management Systems (BMSs). To remedy the situation, several investigations have been carried out to simplify the P2D model. Mathematical and physical techniques are employed to reduce the order of magnitude of the P2D governing equations. The present paper is a review of the studies on the modeling of Li-ion batteries with simplified P2D models. The assumptions on which these models rest are stated, the calculation methods are examined, the advantages and the drawbacks of the models are discussed and their applications are presented. Suggestions for overcoming the shortcomings of the models are made. Challenges and future directions in the modeling of Li-ion batteries are also discussed.},

abstract = {In this paper, effective and systematic steps in the mathematical simplification and reduction of physics-based lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery models to improve computational efficiency will be presented. The battery model used for simulations is an isothermal model proposed by Newman and Tiedemann [1] and Doyle et al. [2] which incorporates the concentrated solution theory, the porous electrode theory, and the variations in electronic/ionic conductivities and diffusivities. The simplified model is formulated by exploiting the nature of the model and the structure of the governing equations. Simulations show that the simplified model can reduce computational time significantly while still retaining the accuracy compared to the full-order rigorous model.},

abstract = {A 1D model based on physical and electrochemical processes of a lithium ion cell is used to describe constant current and hybrid pulse power characterization (HPPC) data from a 6Ah cell designed for hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) application. An approximate solution method for the diffusion of lithium ions within active material particles is formulated using the finite element method and implemented in the previously developed 1D electrochemical model as an explicit difference equation. Reaction current distribution and redistribution processes occurring during discharge and current interrupt, respectively, are driven by gradients in equilibrium potential that arise due to solid diffusion limitations. The model is extrapolated to predict voltage response at discharge rates up to 40C where end of discharge is caused by negative electrode active material surface concentrations near depletion. Simple expressions are derived from an analytical solution to describe solid-state diffusion limited current for short duration, high-rate pulses.},

abstract = {The electrochemistry-based battery model can provide physics-meaningful knowledge about the lithium-ion battery system with extensive computation burdens. To motivate the development of reduced order battery model, three major contributions have been made throughout this paper: (1) the transfer function type of simplified electrochemical model is proposed to address the current-voltage relationship with Pad{\'{e}} approximation method and modified boundary conditions for electrolyte diffusion equations. The model performance has been verified under pulse charge/discharge and dynamic stress test (DST) profiles with the standard derivation less than 0.021 V and the runtime 50 times faster. (2) the parametric relationship between the equivalent circuit model and simplified electrochemical model has been established, which will enhance the comprehension level of two models with more in-depth physical significance and provide new methods for electrochemical model parameter estimation. (3) four simplified electrochemical model parameters: equivalent resistance Req, effective diffusion coefficient in electrolyte phase Deeff, electrolyte phase volume fraction $\epsilon$ and open circuit voltage (OCV), have been identified by the recursive least square (RLS) algorithm with the modified DST profiles under 45, 25 and 0 Â°C. The simulation results indicate that the proposed model coupled with RLS algorithm can achieve high accuracy for electrochemical parameter identification in dynamic scenarios.},

@article{Yuan2017a,
abstract = {To guarantee the safety, high efficiency and long lifetime for lithium-ion battery, an advanced battery management system requires a physics-meaningful yet computationally efficient battery model. The pseudo-two dimensional (P2D) electrochemical model can provide physical information about the lithium concentration and potential distributions across the cell dimension. However, the extensive computation burden caused by the temporal and spatial discretization limits its real-time application. In this research, we propose a new simplified electrochemical model (SEM) by modifying the boundary conditions for electrolyte diffusion equations, which significantly facilitates the analytical solving process. Then to obtain a reduced order transfer function, the Pad{\'{e}} approximation method is adopted to simplify the derived transcendental impedance solution. The proposed model with the reduced order transfer function can be briefly computable and preserve physical meanings through the presence of parameters such as the solid/electrolyte diffusion coefficients (Ds{\&}De) and particle radius. The simulation illustrates that the proposed simplified model maintains high accuracy for electrolyte phase concentration (Ce) predictions, saying 0.8{\%} and 0.24{\%} modeling error respectively, when compared to the rigorous model under 1C-rate pulse charge/discharge and urban dynamometer driving schedule (UDDS) profiles. Meanwhile, this simplified model yields significantly reduced computational burden, which benefits its real-time application.},
