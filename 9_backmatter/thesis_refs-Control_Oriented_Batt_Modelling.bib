abstract = {Over the last decade, many efforts have been deployed to develop models for the prediction, the control, the optimization and the parameter estimation of Lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries. It appears that the most successful electrochemical-based model for Li-ion battery is the Pseudo-two-Dimensional model (P2D). Due to the fact that the governing equations are complex, this model cannot be used in real-time applications like Battery Management Systems (BMSs). To remedy the situation, several investigations have been carried out to simplify the P2D model. Mathematical and physical techniques are employed to reduce the order of magnitude of the P2D governing equations. The present paper is a review of the studies on the modeling of Li-ion batteries with simplified P2D models. The assumptions on which these models rest are stated, the calculation methods are examined, the advantages and the drawbacks of the models are discussed and their applications are presented. Suggestions for overcoming the shortcomings of the models are made. Challenges and future directions in the modeling of Li-ion batteries are also discussed.},

abstract = {A 1D model based on physical and electrochemical processes of a lithium ion cell is used to describe constant current and hybrid pulse power characterization (HPPC) data from a 6Ah cell designed for hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) application. An approximate solution method for the diffusion of lithium ions within active material particles is formulated using the finite element method and implemented in the previously developed 1D electrochemical model as an explicit difference equation. Reaction current distribution and redistribution processes occurring during discharge and current interrupt, respectively, are driven by gradients in equilibrium potential that arise due to solid diffusion limitations. The model is extrapolated to predict voltage response at discharge rates up to 40C where end of discharge is caused by negative electrode active material surface concentrations near depletion. Simple expressions are derived from an analytical solution to describe solid-state diffusion limited current for short duration, high-rate pulses.},

@article{Merla2018,
abstract = {Accurate diagnosis of lithium ion battery state-of-health (SOH) is of significant value for many applications, to improve performance, extend life and increase safety. However, in-situ or in-operando diagnosis of SOH often requires robust models. There are many models available however these often require expensive-to-measure ex-situ parameters and/or contain unmeasurable parameters that were fitted/assumed. In this work, we have developed a new empirically parameterised physics-informed equivalent circuit model. Its modular construction and low-cost parametrisation requirements allow end users to parameterise cells quickly and easily. The model is accurate to 19.6 mV for dynamic loads without any global fitting/optimisation, only that of the individual elements. The consequences of various degradation mechanisms are simulated, and the impact of a degraded cell on pack performance is explored, validated by comparison with experiment. Results show that an aged cell in a parallel pack does not have a noticeable effect on the available capacity of other cells in the pack. The model shows that cells perform better when electrodes are more porous towards the separator and have a uniform particle size distribution, validated by comparison with published data. The model is provided with this publication for readers to use.},

abstract = {In this paper, effective and systematic steps in the mathematical simplification and reduction of physics-based lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery models to improve computational efficiency will be presented. The battery model used for simulations is an isothermal model proposed by Newman and Tiedemann [1] and Doyle et al. [2] which incorporates the concentrated solution theory, the porous electrode theory, and the variations in electronic/ionic conductivities and diffusivities. The simplified model is formulated by exploiting the nature of the model and the structure of the governing equations. Simulations show that the simplified model can reduce computational time significantly while still retaining the accuracy compared to the full-order rigorous model.},

@article{Smith2007,
abstract = {Lithium ion (Li-ion) batteries provide high energy and power density energy storage for diverse applications ranging from cell phones to hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs). For efficient and reliable systems integration, low order dynamic battery models are needed. This paper introduces a general method to generate numerically a fully observable/controllable state variable model from electrochemical kinetic, species and charge partial differential equations that govern the discharge/charge behavior of a Li-ion battery. Validated against a 313th order nonlinear CFD model of a 6Ah HEV cell, a 12th order state variable model predicts terminal voltage to within 1{\%} for pulse and constant current profiles at rates up to 50C. The state equation is constructed in modal form with constant negative real eigenvalues distributed in frequency space from 0 to 10Hz. Open circuit potential, electrode surface concentration/reaction distribution coupling and electrolyte concentration/ionic conductivity nonlinearities are explicitly approximated in the model output equation on a local, electrode-averaged and distributed basis, respectively. The balanced realization controllability/observability gramian indicates that the fast electrode surface concentration dynamics are more observable/controllable than the electrode bulk concentration dynamics (i.e. state of charge).},
