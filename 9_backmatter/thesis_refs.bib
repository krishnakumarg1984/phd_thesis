abstract = {A 1D electrochemical, lumped thermal model is used to explore pulse power limitations and thermal behavior of a 6Ah, 72 cell, 276V nominal Li-ion hybrid-electric vehicle (HEV) battery pack. Depleted/saturated active material Li surface concentrations in the negative/positive electrodes consistently cause end of high-rate (∼25C) pulse discharge at the 2.7Vcell−1 minimum limit, indicating solid-state diffusion is the limiting mechanism. The 3.9Vcell−1 maximum limit, meant to protect the negative electrode from lithium deposition side reaction during charge, is overly conservative for high-rate (∼15C) pulse charges initiated from states-of-charge (SOCs) less than 100{\%}. Two-second maximum pulse charge rate from the 50{\%} SOC initial condition can be increased by as much as 50{\%} without risk of lithium deposition. Controlled to minimum/maximum voltage limits, the pack meets partnership for next generation vehicles (PNGV) power assist mode pulse power goals (at operating temperatures {\textgreater}16°C), but falls short of the available energy goal. In a vehicle simulation, the pack generates heat at a 320W rate on a US06 driving cycle at 25°C, with more heat generated at lower temperatures. Less aggressive FUDS and HWFET cycles generate 6–12 times less heat. Contact resistance ohmic heating dominates all other mechanisms, followed by electrolyte phase ohmic heating. Reaction and electronic phase ohmic heats are negligible. A convective heat transfer coefficient of h=10.1Wm−2K−1 maintains cell temperature at or below the 52°C PNGV operating limit under aggressive US06 driving.},

Commercial lithium-ion batteries from Saft and Shin-Kobe were also tested under similar conditions. Internal resistances were measured by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), as well as by the “iR drop” method. Self discharge measurements were also recorded. Compared with earlier generations of supercapacitors, the cells showed improved current and power capability. However, their energy densities are still too low to meet goals set by Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles (PNGV) for HEV propulsion. Cells that use acetonitrile as the electrolyte solvent yield better performance, although safety issues need to be addressed. New high-power lithium-ion batteries show high energy densities, with high power capabilities.},

@article{Zhang2017,
abstract = {This paper proposes a novel parameter identification method for the lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery equivalent circuit model (ECM) considering the electrochemical properties. An improved pseudo two-dimension (P2D) model is established on basis of partial differential equations (PDEs), since the electrolyte potential is simplified from the nonlinear to linear expression while terminal voltage can be divided into the electrolyte potential, open circuit voltage (OCV), overpotential of electrodes, internal resistance drop, and so on. The model order reduction process is implemented by the simplification of the PDEs using the Laplace transform, inverse Laplace transform, Pade approximation, etc. A unified second order transfer function between cell voltage and current is obtained for the comparability with that of ECM. The final objective is to obtain the relationship between the ECM resistances/capacitances and electrochemical parameters such that in various conditions, ECM precision could be improved regarding integration of battery interior properties for further applications, e.g., SOC estimation. Finally simulation and experimental results prove the correctness and validity of the proposed methodology.},

@article{Farag2017,
abstract = {Model-order reduction and minimization of the CPU run-time while maintaining the model accuracy are critical requirements for real-time implementation of lithium-ion electrochemical battery models. In this paper, an isothermal, continuous, piecewise-linear, electrode-average model is developed by using an optimal knot placement technique. The proposed model reduces the univariate nonlinear function of the electrode's open circuit potential dependence on the state of charge to continuous piecewise regions. The parameterization experiments were chosen to provide a trade-off between extensive experimental characterization techniques and purely identifying all parameters using optimization techniques. The model is then parameterized in each continuous, piecewise-linear, region. Applying the proposed technique cuts down the CPU run-time by around 20{\%}, compared to the reduced-order, electrode-average model. Finally, the model validation against real-time driving profiles (FTP-72, WLTP) demonstrates the ability of the model to predict the cell voltage accurately with less than 2{\%} error.},

This approach is validated by experimental data from cells that underwent normal aging as well as plating and overcharge. Additional validation via modeling showed that the method is able to diagnose cells undergoing any degradation scenario automatically in close to 90{\%} of cases.},

@article{Plett2006,
abstract = {We have previously described algorithms for a battery management system (BMS) that uses Kalman filtering (KF) techniques to estimate such quantities as: cell self-discharge rate, state-of-charge (SOC), nominal capacity, resistance, and others. Since the dynamics of electrochemical cells are not linear, we used a non-linear extension to the original KF called the extended Kalman filter (EKF). We were able to achieve very good estimates of SOC and other states and parameters using EKF. However, some applications e.g., that of the battery-management-system (BMS) of a hybrid-electric-vehicle (HEV) can require even more accurate estimates than these. To see how to improve on EKF, we must examine the mathematical foundation of that algorithm in more detail than we presented in the prior work to discover the assumptions that are made in its derivation. Since these suppositions are not met exactly in BMS application, we explore an alternative non-linear Kalman filtering techniques known as “sigma-point Kalman filtering” (SPKF), which has some theoretical advantages that manifest themselves in more accurate predictions. The computational complexity of SPKF is of the same order as EKF, so the gains are made at little or no additional cost. The SPKF method as applied to BMS algorithms is presented here in a series of two papers. This first paper is devoted primarily to deriving the EKF and SPKF algorithms using the framework of sequential probabilistic inference. This is done to show that the two algorithms, which at first may look quite different, are actually very similar in most respects; also, we discover why we might expect the SPKF to outperform EKF in non-linear estimation applications. Results are presented for a battery pack based on a third-generation prototype LiPB cell, and compared with prior results using EKF. As expected, SPKF outperforms EKF, both in its estimate of SOC and in its estimate of the error bounds thereof. The second paper presents some more advanced algorithms for simultaneous state and parameter estimation, and gives results for a fourth-generation prototype LiPB cell.},

@article{SenthilKumar2013,
abstract = {The detailed isothermal electrochemical model for a lithium ion cell comprises of 10 coupled partial differential equations (PDEs). It is computationally intensive to use this model for detailed parameter estimation, battery packs, battery management system algorithms, calendar or cycle life predictions etc. This work describes a reduced order model framework, which reduces the detailed model PDEs, to a manageable set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs), which can be used for the above applications. Volume averaging PDEs yield ODEs. Hence volume averaging is the basic method used for model reduction. The gradient or profile information lost on volume averaging is recovered through profile based approximations. For the lowest order reduced order model (ROM), a uniform reaction rate, quadratic electrolyte concentrations and quartic solid phase concentrations are assumed. In this ROM only 5 linear ODEs are solved, and the rest are nonlinear algebraic evaluations. When compared with the detailed electrochemical model of a lithium ion cell, this ROM gives negligible error at nominal currents and a maximum error of about 3{\%} at high currents, for a typical commercial cell.},

Here we review this framework, in the context of applications to the coupled modeling of the thermal and electrochemical behavior of cells, and to the modeling at three different scales, namely pore-level, cell-level and stack-level. The similarity and differences of our approach with other research groups are exemplified. Significant results from each of these advanced applications of modeling are highlighted with emphasis on the insights that can be gained from a first-principles model. In addition, we also demonstrate the usefulness of a combined experimental-modeling approach in describing cells.

abstract = {Lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries are ubiquitous sources of energy for portable electronic devices. Compared to alternative battery technologies, Li-ion batteries provide one of the best energy-to-weight ratios, exhibit no memory effect, and have low self-discharge when not in use. These beneficial properties, as well as decreasing costs, have established Li-ion batteries as a leading candidate for the next generation of automotive and aerospace applications. In the automotive sector, increasing demand for hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), plug-in HEVs (PHEVs), and EVs has pushed manufacturers to the limits of contemporary automotive battery technology. This limitation is gradually forcing consideration of alternative battery technologies, such as Li-ion batteries, as a replacement for existing leadacid and nickel-metal-hydride batteries. Unfortunately, this replacement is a challenging task since automotive applications demand large amounts of energy and power and must operate safely, reliably, and durably at these scales. The article presents a detailed description and model of a Li-ion battery. It begins the section "Intercalation-Based Batteries" by providing an intuitive explanation of the fundamentals behind storing energy in a Li-ion battery. In the sections "Modeling Approach" and "Li-Ion Battery Model," it present equations that describe a Li-ion cell's dynamic behavior. This modeling is based on using electrochemical principles to develop a physics-based model in contrast to equivalent circuit models. A goal of this article is to present the electrochemical model from a controls perspective.},

abstract = {Accurate state of charge estimation of lithium-ion battery is directly related to the safe operation of electric vehicles and also an indispensable function of the battery management system. Four aspects of efforts are made to improve the estimation accuracy. First, for overcoming the drawbacks of equivalent circuit model and electrochemical model, the fractional order impedance model is built via electrochemical impedance spectroscopy data and the fractional element is used to describe the polarization effect in a simple and meaningful way. Second, the discrete state-space equations of the impedance model are inferred by Gr{\"{u}}nwald-Letnikov definition and parameters of the model including the order of the fractional element are identified together by genetic algorithm (GA) and the experiment data of the dynamic driving cycles. Third, the fractional order unscented Kalman filter technique is presented and the ‘short memory' technique is employed to improve the computation efficiency of fractional operator. Lastly, experimental validation is implemented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach and results show that the SoC estimation accuracy can be improved by the proposed model and estimation method. The estimation error can be controlled within the range of 3{\%}.},

abstract = {The effectiveness factor problem for heat and mass transfer with chemical reaction in a catalyst pellet is solved with a new technique especially suited to situations corresponding to high Thiele modulus when the solution is confined to a thin boundary region near the catalyst surface. The method of orthogonal collocation on finite elements combines the rapid convergence of the orthogonal collocation method with the convenience associated with finite difference methods of locating grid points or elements where the solution is important or has large gradients. The efficiency of the method results from block LU decompositions employed in the iterative schemes devised. The method is applied to two problems to illustrate the rate of convergence, the efficiency (as expressed by error versus computation time curves), and the use of the residual for optimum location of the finite elements. Comparisons are also made to usual orthogonal collocation and finite difference methods.},

abstract = {This paper presents a numerical framework for automating the design of lithium-ion cells to maximize cell energy density while meeting specific power density requirements. The various processes in a battery cell are simulated using a physics-based electrochemistry model. The design is automatically performed by coupling the battery model with a gradient-based optimization algorithm. We demonstrate the potential for gradient-based optimization by applying this framework to optimize the design of a lithium-ion cell with spinel manganese dioxide cathode and meso-carbon micro beads (MCMB) anode for a range of power requirements. Results indicate that variations in the electrode thickness and porosity at optimal cell designs can be quantified via active mass ratios and it is found that the active mass ratios for optimal cell designs are independent of discharge rate. },

abstract = {A physics-based Li-ion battery (LIB) aging model accounting for both lithium plating and solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) growth is presented, and is applied to study the aging behavior of a cell undergoing prolonged cycling at moderate operating conditions. Cell aging is found to be linear in the early stage of cycling but highly nonlinear in the end with rapid capacity drop and resistance rise. The linear aging stage is found to be dominated by SEI growth, while the transition from linear to nonlinear aging is attributed to the sharp rise of lithium plating rate. Lithium plating starts to occur in a narrow portion of the anode near the separator after a certain number of cycles. The onset of lithium plating is attributed to the drop of anode porosity associated with SEI growth, which aggravates the local electrolyte potential gradient in the anode. The presence of lithium metal accelerates the porosity reduction, further promoting lithium plating. This positive feedback leads to exponential increase of lithium plating rate in the late stage of cycling, as well as local pore clogging near the anode/separator interface which in turn leads to a sharp resistance rise.},

abstract = {Lithium ion (Li-ion) batteries provide high energy and power density energy storage for diverse applications ranging from cell phones to hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs). For efficient and reliable systems integration, low order dynamic battery models are needed. This paper introduces a general method to generate numerically a fully observable/controllable state variable model from electrochemical kinetic, species and charge partial differential equations that govern the discharge/charge behavior of a Li-ion battery. Validated against a 313th order nonlinear CFD model of a 6Ah HEV cell, a 12th order state variable model predicts terminal voltage to within 1{\%} for pulse and constant current profiles at rates up to 50C. The state equation is constructed in modal form with constant negative real eigenvalues distributed in frequency space from 0 to 10Hz. Open circuit potential, electrode surface concentration/reaction distribution coupling and electrolyte concentration/ionic conductivity nonlinearities are explicitly approximated in the model output equation on a local, electrode-averaged and distributed basis, respectively. The balanced realization controllability/observability gramian indicates that the fast electrode surface concentration dynamics are more observable/controllable than the electrode bulk concentration dynamics (i.e. state of charge).},

abstract = {High Seebeck coefficient by creating large density-of-states effective mass through either electronic structure modification or manipulating nanostructures is commonly considered as a route to advanced thermoelectrics. However, large density-of-state due to flat bands leads to large transport effective mass, which results in a simultaneous decrease of mobility. In fact, the net effect of such a high effective mass is a lower thermoelectric figure of merit, zT, when the carriers are predominantly scattered by phonons according to the deformation potential theory of Bardeen–Shockley. We demonstrate that the beneficial effect of light effective mass contributes to high zT in n-type thermoelectric PbTe, where doping and temperature can be used to tune the effective mass. This clear demonstration of the deformation potential theory to thermoelectrics shows that the guiding principle for band structure engineering should be low effective mass along the transport direction.},

abstract = {The design of predictive, electrochemical, Li-ion battery models and the use of model-order reduction techniques to extract low-order models enables researchers to address problems related to model-based control, estimation, aging, and life-cycle prediction. This paper presents a novel approach to the design and parametrization of a reduced-order model characterizing the dynamic voltage response of a Li-ion cell. The model is based on the assumption of uniform active material utilization and includes prediction of the ionic concentration and potential dynamics in the liquid phase, which significantly affects the voltage response for high currents. A model-order reduction procedure based on the Pade approximation method is used to reduce the partial differential equation model to a low-order system of ordinary differential equations. Systematic methods are proposed to identify the electrochemical parameters that govern power and capacity prediction, as well as their temperature dependence. The procedure is based on carefully designed experiments that isolate the influence of small groups of parameters on the voltage output, utilizing complete cell data for model identification almost entirely in place of half-cell characterization. Finally, an extensive validation with experimental data illustrates the ability of the model to accurately predict the cell voltage.},

abstract = {If electrode kinetics ape fast and concentration gradients can be ignored, the reaction in a battery electrode is confined to a narrow zone, which moves through the electrode as the battery is discharged. During this process, the ohmic resistance increases, and the cutoff potential may signal the end of the discharge. It is desirable to have a matching of the capacity of the electrode (and hence its thickness) with the time t(d) of discharge. Assuming that there is d certain specified separator thickness and that the electrolyte of the separator is the same as that permeating the positive electrode, it is possible to obtain the optimum porosity as a compromise between the desire to have active material present and the necessity to have a conduction path through the pores of the electrode. For a system with a foil negative electrode and an open-circuit potential which is independent of state of charge, this optimum value depends on one principal parameter T = U kappa(s)t(d)/q(+)L(s)(2), one which involves the time of discharge, the open-circuit potential U, the conductivity kappa(s), and thickness L(s) of the separator, and the capacity q(+) per unit volume of solids in the positive electrode. There is one other parameter: the ratio of the cutoff potential to the open-circuit potential. Other parameters are introduced to account for a more complex structure of the battery.},

abstract = {Accurate diagnosis of lithium ion battery state-of-health (SOH) is of significant value for many applications, to improve performance, extend life and increase safety. However, in-situ or in-operando diagnosis of SOH often requires robust models. There are many models available however these often require expensive-to-measure ex-situ parameters and/or contain unmeasurable parameters that were fitted/assumed. In this work, we have developed a new empirically parameterised physics-informed equivalent circuit model. Its modular construction and low-cost parametrisation requirements allow end users to parameterise cells quickly and easily. The model is accurate to 19.6 mV for dynamic loads without any global fitting/optimisation, only that of the individual elements. The consequences of various degradation mechanisms are simulated, and the impact of a degraded cell on pack performance is explored, validated by comparison with experiment. Results show that an aged cell in a parallel pack does not have a noticeable effect on the available capacity of other cells in the pack. The model shows that cells perform better when electrodes are more porous towards the separator and have a uniform particle size distribution, validated by comparison with published data. The model is provided with this publication for readers to use.},

abstract = {Compared with other commonly used batteries, lithium-ion batteries are featured by high energy density, high power density, long service life and environmental friendliness and thus have found wide application in the area of consumer electronics. However, lithium-ion batteries for vehicles have high capacity and large serial-parallel numbers, which, coupled with such problems as safety, durability, uniformity and cost, imposes limitations on the wide application of lithium-ion batteries in the vehicle. The narrow area in which lithium-ion batteries operate with safety and reliability necessitates the effective control and management of battery management system. This present paper, through the analysis of literature and in combination with our practical experience, gives a brief introduction to the composition of the battery management system (BMS) and its key issues such as battery cell voltage measurement, battery states estimation, battery uniformity and equalization, battery fault diagnosis and so on, in the hope of providing some inspirations to the design and research of the battery management system. {\textcopyright}2012 Published by Elsevier B.V.

@article{Choe2013,
abstract = {Comparably long charging time for battery of electric and hybrid vehicles is one of barriers for massive commercialization of the vehicles. Typical charging methods are by a constant current (CC) with constant voltage (CV), pulsed or tapered current. Theoretically, the charging time can be reduced by increased amplitude of the charging current, which, however, accelerate degradation of cells and reduces the lifespan. The relationship between the charging current and the degradation has not been well understood. Studies on ion transport and chemical reactions using a computational model developed in our laboratory reveal that a high charging current causes excessive ions at the surface of electrode particles because of slow diffusion process of ions in the solid electrodes. The excessive lithium ions react with electrons and form a thin layer, called Lithium plating that is irreversible. The Lithium plating not only reduces ion conductivities, but also contributes growth of dendrites and potentially internal short circuit. In this paper, a new charging algorithm is proposed that is based on an electrochemical and thermal model, which order is drastically reduced in order to facilitate a real time operation. The model, called Reduced Order of Electrochemical Thermal Model (ROM), is completely validated with a pouch type of Lithium polymer battery and used to dynamically estimate ion concentration at the surface of particles. Based on the estimated ion concentration, a new control algorithm is derived that allows for determination of amplitude and duration of the charging current. The ROM performs at least ten fold faster in calculations than the original full order model. The simulation and experimental results show that the charging time can be reduced to 60-70{\%} of that of the classical CC/CV charging by preventing excessive ions and slowing down degradation of cell capacity losses.},

abstract = {The design of a lumped parameter battery model preserving physical meaning is especially desired by the automotive researchers and engineers due to the strong demand for battery system control, estimation, diagnosis and prognostics. In light of this, a novel simplified fractional order electrochemical model is developed for electric vehicle (EV) applications in this paper. In the model, a general fractional order transfer function is designed for the solid phase lithium ion diffusion approximation. The dynamic characteristics of the electrolyte concentration overpotential are approximated by a first-order resistance-capacitor transfer function in the electrolyte phase. The Ohmic resistances and electrochemical reaction kinetics resistance are simplified to a lumped Ohmic resistance parameter. Overall, the number of model parameters is reduced from 30 to 9, yet the accuracy of the model is still guaranteed. In order to address the dynamics of phase-change phenomenon in the active particle during charging and discharging, variable solid-state diffusivity is taken into consideration in the model. Also, the observability of the model is analyzed on two types of lithium ion batteries subsequently. Results show the fractional order model with variable solid-state diffusivity agrees very well with experimental data at various current input conditions and is suitable for electric vehicle applications.},

abstract = {Battery design variable optimization can significantly affect battery capacity, discharge specific power, and discharge specific energy. However, many design variables need to be taken into consideration, which requires intensive computation and simulation. Our previously developed comprehensive battery degradation model is utilized in this optimization study via parallel computing. A three-electrode cell is developed for model validation over long term cycling. The objectives of optimization are maximizing discharge specific power and specific energy as well as minimizing capacity loss. Several design variables (e.g., thickness, particle size, and porosity) are optimized through a modified Elitist Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II). The obtained Pareto-optimal solutions that show electrode thickness, particle sizes, porosity, and conductivity are the battery design variables that can significantly affect battery performance. In addition, a sensitivity analysis suggests that a thicker electrode and a smaller particle size can improve battery performance. The optimized batteries have a better performance over 750 cycle's simulation: less SOC swing and less reduction of capacity. The design optimization framework developed herein can be modified and applied to various type of batteries with different optimization objectives and battery design variables.},

It is able to estimate the SoC when the model parameters are unknown, through joint SoC and parameter estimation. Design of the AdaptSoC builds up on (1) a reduced complexity battery model that is developed from the well-known single particle model (SPM) and, (2) joint local observability/identifiability analysis of the SoC and the unknown model parameters. Shown to be strongly observable, the SoC is estimated jointly with the parameters by the AdaptSoC using the iterated extended Kalman filter (IEKF).

abstract = {This book is a pedagogical presentation of the application of spectral and pseudospectral methods to kinetic theory and quantum mechanics. There are additional applications to astrophysics, engineering, biology and many other fields. The main objective of this book is to provide the basic concepts to enable the use of spectral and pseudospectral methods to solve problems in diverse fields of interest and to a wide audience. While spectral methods are generally based on Fourier Series or Chebychev polynomials, non-classical polynomials and associated quadratures are used for many of the applications presented in the book. Fourier series methods are summarized with a discussion of the resolution of the Gibbs phenomenon. Classical and non-classical quadratures are used for the evaluation of integrals in reaction dynamics including nuclear fusion, radial integrals in density functional theory, in elastic scattering theory and other applications. The subject matter includes the calculation of transport coefficients in gases and other gas dynamical problems based on spectral and pseudospectral solutions of the Boltzmann equation. Radiative transfer in astrophysics and atmospheric science, and applications to space physics are discussed. The relaxation of initial non-equilibrium distributions to equilibrium for several different systems is studied with the Boltzmann and Fokker-Planck equations. The eigenvalue spectra of the linear operators in the Boltzmann, Fokker-Planck and Schrödinger equations are studied with spectral and pseudospectral methods based on non-classical orthogonal polynomials. The numerical methods referred to as the Discrete Ordinate Method, Differential Quadrature, the Quadrature Discretization Method, the Discrete Variable Representation, the Lagrange Mesh Method, and others are discussed and compared. MATLAB codes are provided for most of the numerical results reported in the book.

The pseudo steady state (PSS) method is a method that has been used recently to develop a solution to the diffusion equation in a spherical particle with time dependent boundary conditions, but the PSS method has not been used in a porous electrode model. These methods are compared to each other in a dimensionless analysis study, and they are used in a porous electrode model to predict the discharge curves for a LiCoO2 electrode.

abstract = {Physics-based model has been regarded as a promising alternative to equivalent circuit model due to its ability to describe internal electrochemical states of battery. However, the rigorous physics-based model, namely pseudo-two-dimensional (P2D) model, is too complicated for online application in embedded battery management system. In this paper, to simplify the P2D model, a series of polynomial functions are employed to approximate the electrolyte phase concentration profile, solid phase concentration profile, and non-uniform reaction flux profile, respectively. Especially, the accuracy of 2nd-order and 3rd-order polynomial approximations for reaction flux is compared, and the higher-order is validated with more strength. Benefit from the acquisition of above variables, the electrolyte potential is derived directly according to the conservation of charge at electrolyte phase; the accuracy of activation overpotential is also improved by using the non-uniform reaction flux rather than assuming the uniform current density in single particle (SP) model. Finally, the developed model is simulated by different constant current rates, hybrid pulse and driving cycles, and its outputs are compared with P2D model and original SP model. The results demonstrate that the model proposed in this paper could capture the battery characteristics efficiently, and also significantly reduce the computation complexity.},

abstract = {Increased driving range and enhanced fast charging capabilities are two immediate goals of transport electrifi cation. However, these are of competing nature, leading to increased energy and power demand respectively from the on-board battery pack. By fi ne-tuning the number of layers versus active electrode material of a lithium ion pouch cell, tailored designs targeting either of these goals can be obtained. Achieving this trade-off through iterative empirical testing of layer choices is expensive and often produces sub-optimal designs. This paper presents a model-based methodology for determining the optimal number of layers, maximising usable energy whilst satisfying specifi c acceleration and fast charging targets. The proposed methodology accounts for the critical need to avoid lithium plating during fast charging and searches for the optimal layer confi guration considering a range of thermal conditions. A numerical implementation of a cell model using a hybrid fi nite volume-spectral scheme is presented, wherein the model equations are suitably reformulated to directly accept power inputs, facilitating rapid and accurate searching of the layer design space. We show how thermal management design can limit vehicle driving range at high charging temperatures. We highlight how electrode materials exhibiting increased solid phase diffusion rates are as equally important for extended range as developing new materials with higher inherent capacity. We illustrate for a plug-in hybrid vehicle, how the proposed methodology facilitates common module design of battery packs, thereby reducing the cost of derivative vehicle models. To facilitate model based layer optimisation, we provide the open-source toolbox, BOLD (Battery Optimal Layer Design).},

abstract = {Battery cell life depends critically on how the cell is used. Therefore, battery chargers and battery management systems must be designed to control cell usage carefully. In order to design optimal battery controls that effect a tradeoff between cell performance (in some sense) and cell life, a model of cell degradation is necessary. This model must be simple and incremental in order to be implemented by an inexpensive microcontroller. This paper takes a first step toward developing such a controls-oriented comprehensive cell degradation model by deriving a reduced-order model of a single mechanism: lithium deposition on overcharge, along with the resulting resistance rise and capacity loss. This reduced-order model approximates a physics-based PDE model from the literature, is simple and accurate, and may be used in optimal strategies for controlling lithium ion batteries. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The design is based on the Backstepping PDE methodology, including a modified Volterra transformation to compensate for the diffusivity uncertainty. The resulting coupled/uncoupled Kernel-PDE and Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) are recast, via a Sum-of-Squares decomposition, in terms of a convex optimization problem and solved by semidefinite programming, allowing, at each fixed time, an efficient computation of the state and parameter observer gains. In addition, based on the Moment approach, a novel scheme of inversion of the nonlinear output mapping of the Single Particle Model is presented. The effectiveness of this approach is illustrated by numerical simulations.},

From an electrochemical model available in the literature, several assumptions and simplifying hypotheses are proposed in order to get a simpler but accurate model.

The model involves only three parameters and a polynomial that fits the open circuit voltage of the battery. A method to estimate the model parameters and the polynomial is proposed. A single discharge test (constituted of several discharge steps) is required to operate the parameter estimation method.

abstract = {We present a method to produce a physics-based one-dimensional discrete-time state-space reduced-order model (ROM) of a lithium-ion cell. The resulting ROM can predict the five variables of a standard porous-electrode model—reaction flux, solid and electrolyte lithium concentration, and solid and electrolyte potentials—at any location across the cell cross section, as well as cell terminal voltage. The method to generate the model involves first linearizing the porous-electrode-model equations, and then deriving closed-form Laplace-domain transfer functions from the linearized equations. Next, the discrete-time realization algorithm (DRA) is used to convert the transfer functions into an optimal discrete-time state-space realization. Advantages of this approach include that the DRA avoids nonlinear optimization and gives a straightforward method for selecting the system order for the ROM. Simulation results demonstrate that the ROM cell voltage predictions and the ROM internal electrochemical variable predictions match very closely with results obtained by simulating the full nonlinear porous-electrode partial differential equations.},

@article{Uhlmann2015,
abstract = {Lithium plating is a common problem for charging in high-rate and low-temperature Li-ion battery applications. The current "standard anode" material graphite is especially susceptible to the formation of lithium metal on its surface instead of intercalation. In order to improve the understanding of this phenomenon, this investigation was conducted using pulse-relaxation experiments, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and optical in-situ microscopy. For that purpose, current pulses up to 10 C were applied on graphite half-cells to induce plating on the anode's surface. The resulting characteristics (e.g., cell voltage and changes in surface morphology) were analyzed during pulses and subsequent relaxation. Several characteristic attributes could be detected whenever lithium plating occurred: i) a prominent kink of the voltage transient during charging, ii) a distinctive plateau in the subsequent relaxation of the cell voltage, iii) a gray deposit covering the anode surface which under high magnification shows iv) a net-like structure covering the carbon particles. These attributes may provide useful detection tools for Li plating. The observed characteristics for Li plating were explained regarding the involved microscopic processes. This model was used to understand dissolution of plated lithium on the particle surface after the charging pulse and could thus be confirmed by SEM investigations.},

To assess the loss of battery capacity through cycling, the reduction of the electrolyte (ethylene carbonate) is considered as a side reaction. The battery is cycled until the end-of-life conditions are met: EODV (end of discharge voltage) below 3V or capacity fading greater than 20{\%} of the initial capacity of the battery. A gradient-based optimization is performed, identifying the maximum number of cycles within the simulated conditions. The influence of time of discharge, depth-of-discharge and ageing parameters is also assessed.},

abstract = {Over the last decade, many efforts have been deployed to develop models for the prediction, the control, the optimization and the parameter estimation of Lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries. It appears that the most successful electrochemical-based model for Li-ion battery is the Pseudo-two-Dimensional model (P2D). Due to the fact that the governing equations are complex, this model cannot be used in real-time applications like Battery Management Systems (BMSs). To remedy the situation, several investigations have been carried out to simplify the P2D model. Mathematical and physical techniques are employed to reduce the order of magnitude of the P2D governing equations. The present paper is a review of the studies on the modeling of Li-ion batteries with simplified P2D models. The assumptions on which these models rest are stated, the calculation methods are examined, the advantages and the drawbacks of the models are discussed and their applications are presented. Suggestions for overcoming the shortcomings of the models are made. Challenges and future directions in the modeling of Li-ion batteries are also discussed.},

abstract = {To guarantee the safety, high efficiency and long lifetime for lithium-ion battery, an advanced battery management system requires a physics-meaningful yet computationally efficient battery model. The pseudo-two dimensional (P2D) electrochemical model can provide physical information about the lithium concentration and potential distributions across the cell dimension. However, the extensive computation burden caused by the temporal and spatial discretization limits its real-time application. In this research, we propose a new simplified electrochemical model (SEM) by modifying the boundary conditions for electrolyte diffusion equations, which significantly facilitates the analytical solving process. Then to obtain a reduced order transfer function, the Pad{\'{e}} approximation method is adopted to simplify the derived transcendental impedance solution. The proposed model with the reduced order transfer function can be briefly computable and preserve physical meanings through the presence of parameters such as the solid/electrolyte diffusion coefficients (Ds{\&}De) and particle radius. The simulation illustrates that the proposed simplified model maintains high accuracy for electrolyte phase concentration (Ce) predictions, saying 0.8{\%} and 0.24{\%} modeling error respectively, when compared to the rigorous model under 1C-rate pulse charge/discharge and urban dynamometer driving schedule (UDDS) profiles. Meanwhile, this simplified model yields significantly reduced computational burden, which benefits its real-time application.},

The micro-fiber technique allows one to isolate the properties intrinsic to the lithiation process, and the results are not complicated by the influence of binders, electronically conductive additives, current collectors, or other components necessary for the fabrication of porous carbon electrodes. The results indicate that the electrode can tolerate moderately negative potentials because the lithium insertion process is facile relative to that of lithium deposition. For sufficiently negative potentials, however, lithium deposition occurs, an event that is exacerbated by increasing the lithium content within the carbon.},

abstract = {A real-time determination of battery parameters is challenging because batteries are non-linear, time-varying systems. The transient behaviour of lithium-ion batteries is modelled by a Thevenin-equivalent circuit with two time constants characterising activation and concentration polarization. An experimental approach is proposed for directly determining battery parameters as a function of physical quantities. The model's parameters are a function of the state of charge and of the discharge rate. These can be expressed by regression equations in the model to derive a continuous-discrete extended Kalman estimator of the state of charge and of other parameters. This technique is based on numerical integration of the ordinary differential equations to predict the state of the stochastic dynamic system and the corresponding error covariance matrix. Then a standard correction step of the extended Kalman filter (EKF) is applied to increase the accuracy of estimated parameters. Simulations resulting from this proposed estimator model were compared with experimental results under a variety of operating scenarios—analysis of the results demonstrate the accuracy of the estimator for correctly identifying battery parameters.},

abstract = {A low-order battery model has been developed that incorporates stress-enhanced diffusion and electrolyte concentration distribution into a modified single particle model. This model addresses two important challenges of battery modeling for Battery Management Systems: accuracy and computational efficiency. The developed model improves accuracy by including the potential drop in the electrolyte based on the predicted li-ion concentration profile along the entire electrode thickness, and by including the enhanced diffusivity due to diffusion-induced stress. Incorporating analytical solutions into a conventional single particle model eliminates the need to sacrifice calculation efficiency. The voltage prediction by the proposed model is more accurate than the conventional single particle model. Compared to complex physics-based battery models, the proposed model significantly improves the computational efficiency of various discharge scenarios, including constant current, the Dynamic Stress Test, and the Highway Fuel Economy Test. Integrating mechanical responses into the single particle model not only increases model accuracy, but also makes it applicable to models for next-generation high energy density materials where mechanical volume changes are important.

This effect, named lithium plating, may severely affect the performance, reliability and safety of the cell. Because metallic lithium at the anode consumes more space than intercalated into the graphite, the cell volume increases in the case of lithium plating. An experimental setup for precise measuring the thickness of pouch cells with a resolution of 1 ??m was built. The cell thickness as a function of its charge under standard cycling conditions was recorded as a reference. In the case of lithium plating an additional increase of the thickness was observed. This can be used as an indicator for the non-destructive detection of lithium plating in pouch cells. Compared with the standard capacity based methods this procedure allows a higher sensitivity and gives results more quickly. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Battery management systems in hybrid electric vehicle battery packs must estimate values descriptive of the pack's present operating condition. These include: battery state of charge, power fade, capacity fade, and instantaneous available power. The estimation mechanism must adapt to changing cell characteristics as cells age and therefore provide accurate estimates over the lifetime of the pack. In a series of three papers, we propose a method, based on extended Kalman filtering (EKF), that is able to accomplish these goals on a lithium ion polymer battery pack. We expect that it will also work well on other battery chemistries. These papers cover the required mathematical background, cell modeling and system identification requirements, and the final solution, together with results. In order to use EKF to estimate the desired quantities, we first require a mathematical model that can accurately capture the dynamics of a cell. In this paper we " evolve " a suitable model from one that is very primitive to one that is more advanced and works well in practice. The final model includes terms that describe the dynamic contributions due to open-circuit voltage, ohmic loss, polarization time constants, electro-chemical hysteresis, and the effects of temperature. We also give a means, based on EKF, whereby the constant model parameters may be determined from cell test data. Results are presented that demonstrate it is possible to achieve root-mean-squared modeling error smaller than the level of quantization error expected in an implementation.

The rate of SEI film growth depends on both solvent diffusion through the SEI film and solvent-reduction kinetics at the carbon surface. The model is able to simulate a wide variety of battery aging profiles, e.g., open-circuit and constant-voltage storage, charge/discharge cycling, etc. An analysis of capacity-fade data from the literature reveals that the same set of aging parameters may be used for predicting cycling and constant-voltage storage. The use of this set of parameters for predicting storage under open-circuit voltage points out that part of the self-discharge is reversible.},

abstract = {Charging procedures at low temperatures severely shorten the cycle life of lithium ion batteries due to lithium deposition on the negative electrode. In this paper, cycle life tests are conducted to reveal the influence of the charging current rate and the cut-off voltage limit on the aging mechanisms of a large format LiFePO4 battery at a low temperature (-10 °C). The capacity degradation rates accelerate rapidly after the charging current reaches 0.25 C or the cut-off voltage reaches 3.55 V. Therefore the scheduled current and voltage during low-temperature charging should be reconsidered to avoid capacity degradation. Lithium deposition contributes to low-temperature aging mechanisms, as something needle-like which might be deposited lithium is observed on the surface of the negative electrode after disassembling the aged battery cell. To confirm our explanation, incremental capacity analysis (ICA) is performed to identify the characteristics of the lithium deposition induced battery aging mechanisms. Furthermore, the aging mechanism is quantified using a mechanistic model, whose parameters are estimated with the particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO). The loss of reversible lithium originating from secondary SEI formation and dead lithium is confirmed as the cause of the aging.},

The potential and current-density distribution on the electrodes of a LIPB were predicted as a function of the discharge time using the finite element method. In addition, the temperature distributions of the LIPB were calculated based on the modeling results of the potential and current-density distributions.

The method relies on linearizing the standard porous-electrode equations around a fixed state-of-charge (SOC) and operating temperature setpoint. The ROM is able to track a highly dynamic input accurately near the linearization setpoint, but its performance degrades as either the cell's SOC or temperature move away from this linearization point. This paper describes a way to extend the accuracy of the ROM over a wide range of SOCs and temperatures using a model-blending approach. Our results demonstrate that the approach accurately models the cell's voltage and internal electrochemical variables over a wide range of temperature and SOC, with little added computational complexity. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The capacity of lithium ion batteries can be improved through the use of functionally graded electrodes. Here, we present a computational framework for optimizing the layout of electrodes using a multiscale lithium ion battery cell model. The model accounts for nonlinear transient transport processes and mechan- ical deformations at multiple scales. A key component of the optimization methodology is the formulation of the adjoint sensitivity equations of the multiscale battery model. The efficient solution of the adjoint equations relies on the decomposition of the multiscale problem into multiple, computationally small prob- lems associated with the individual realizations of the microscale model. This decomposition method is shown to significantly reduce the computational time needed for sensitivity analysis versus numerical finite differencing. The potential of the proposed optimization framework is illustrated with numerical problems involving both macroscale and microscale performance criteria and design variables. The usable capacity of a lithium ion battery cell is maximized while limiting the stress level in the electrode particles through manipulation of the local porosities and particle radii. The optimization results suggest that optimal func- tionally graded electrodes improve the performance of a battery cell over using uniform porosity and particle radius distributions. Copyright},

abstract = {Lithium plating is a typical aging mechanism of lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries at low temperatures and high charge rates. Therefore an instant detection method is needed for safe battery operation and to increase the life time. Detection of lithium plating during operation is only possible by nondestructive analysis of short-term plating effects. In this study, we present a new approach to detect, characterize, and quantify lithium plating in a commercial graphite/LiFePO4 battery. This is crucial for battery management systems (BMS) in real-world applications. The method is based on a high voltage plateau in the discharge profile after charging at plating conditions. This voltage plateau corresponds to the stripping of plated lithium from the graphite surface. It is shown that differential analysis of such voltage profiles provides a quantitative estimation of lithium plating. The correlation between lithium plating and stripping necessitates a distinction of reversible and irreversible plating. Effects of various operating conditions, i.e. charge temperature, state-of-charge (SOC), and charge current, on the plating behavior are investigated in order to elucidate this degradation mode. Furthermore, the presented approach allows for determination of the reversibility of lithium plating. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT
The single-particle model is a useful mathematical representation for state-of-charge observation, parameter identification and control of lithium-ion batteries. This model is a simplified electrochemical formulation where ionic intercalation, described as a diffusive process, is considered as the dominant dynamics. In the search for a more efficient numerical solution of the involved partial differential equations, many approximations have been reported. However, most of them are valid just under restricted operating conditions. In this paper, spatial semidiscretization is reintroduced as the precision of approximations could be arbitrarily chosen with this approach. Three discretization methods are applied in a classical fashion, evaluated and compared in both time and frequency domains: finite difference, finite element and differential quadrature. In addition, two commonly used low order approximations are tested against semidiscretization approximations. The best results are obtained with the differential quadrature method in its polynomial version. Two model truncation criteria are also explored, one is based on bandwidth selection and the other on residue analysis, where the first resulted to be more conservative. Finally, simulations of representative reduced order approximations of the single-particle model are compared against experimental data found in the literature.},

abstract = {This paper presents a numerical calculation of the evolution of the spatially resolved solid concentration in the two electrodes of a lithium-ion cell. The microscopic solid concentration is driven by the macroscopic Butler–Volmer current density distribution, which is consequently driven by the applied current through the boundary conditions. The resulting, mostly causal, implementation of the algebraic differential equations that describe the battery electrochemical principles, even after assuming fixed electrolyte concentration, is of high order and complexity and is denoted as the full order model. The full order model is compared with the results in the works of Smith and Wang (2006, “Solid-State Diffusion Limitations on Pulse Operation of a Lithium-Ion Cell for Hybrid Electric Vehicles,” J. Power Sources, 161, pp. 628–639) and Wang (2007 “Control oriented 1D Electrochemical Model of Lithium Ion Battery,” Energy Convers. Manage., 48, pp. 2565–2578) and creates our baseline model, which will be further simplified for charge estimation. We then propose a low order extended Kalman filter for the estimation of the average-electrode charge similarly to the single-particle charge estimation in the work of White and Santhanagopalan (2006, “Online Estimation of the State of Charge of a Lithium Ion Cell,” J. Power Sources, 161, pp. 1346–1355) with the following two substantial enhancements. First, we estimate the average-electrode, or single-particle, solid-electrolyte surface concentration, called critical surface charge in addition to the more traditional bulk concentration called state of charge. Moreover, we avoid the weakly observable conditions associated with estimating both electrode concentrations by recognizing that the measured cell voltage depends on the difference, and not the absolute value, of the two electrode open circuit voltages. The estimation results of the reduced, single, averaged electrode model are compared with the full order model simulation.},

abstract = {Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) capable of drawing tractive energy from the electric grid represent an energy efficient alternative to conventional vehicles. After several thousand charge depleting cycles, PHEV traction batteries can be subject to energy and power degradation which has the potential to affect vehicle performance and efficiency. This study seeks to understand the effect of battery degradation and the need for battery replacement in PHEVs through the experimental measurement of lithium ion battery lifetime under PHEV-type driving and charging conditions. The dynamic characteristics of the battery performance over its lifetime are then input into a vehicle performance and fuel consumption simulation to understand these effects as a function of battery degradation state, and as a function of vehicle control strategy. The results of this study show that active management of PHEV battery degradation by the vehicle control system can improve PHEV performance and fuel consumption relative to a more passive baseline. Simulation of the performance of the PHEV throughout its battery lifetime shows that battery replacement will be neither economically incentivized nor necessary to maintain performance in PHEVs. These results have important implications for techno-economic evaluations of PHEVs which have treated battery replacement and its costs with inconsistency. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

This reversible and SOC-depending capacity rise is explained by the passive electrode effect in this work.

The theory is validated using a systematic test of 50 cylindrical 8 Ah LiFePO4|Graphite battery cells analyzed during cyclic and calendaric aging. The cyclic aging has been performed symmetrically at 40{\"{i}}¿½{\"{i}}¿½C cell temperature, varying current rates and DODs. The calendar aging is executed at three temperatures and up to four SOCs. The aging is dominated by capacity fade while the increase of internal resistance is hardly influenced.

In order to design an optimal thick electrode, understanding how performance loss occurs is necessary. While it is known that both ionic and electronic conductivity contribute to rate performance, we observed a stronger correlation between electronic conductivity and electrochemical performance of electrodes at a loading of {\textgreater}25 mg/cm2 under C/3 to 1C, rates most relevant to electric vehicle applications. To illustrate this effect, we explore the mud-cracking phenomenon during electrode fabrication to obtain narrow, vertical channels which reduce electrode tortuosity, and therefore decrease the liquid phase ionic resistance in thick electrodes. Variation in crack densities enables us to systematically investigate the effects of ionic and electronic conductivity on electrochemical performance in electrodes with identical overall porosity and composition. Rate and cycling performances of mud-cracked thick electrodes have stronger correlations with electronic conductivity than ionic conductivity. These findings shed new light on the relative importance of electronic versus ionic conductivities, arguing for the need to further optimize electronic conduction in thick electrodes when they are cycled in conditions relevant to electric vehicle applications.},

abstract = {Battery management systems in hybrid electric vehicle battery packs must estimate values descriptive of the pack's present operating condition. These include: battery state of charge, power fade, capacity fade, and instantaneous available power. The estimation mechanism must adapt to changing cell characteristics as cells age and therefore provide accurate estimates over the lifetime of the pack. In a series of three papers, we propose a method, based on extended Kalman filtering (EKF), that is able to accomplish these goals on a lithium ion polymer battery pack. We expect that it will also work well on other battery chemistries. These papers cover the required mathematical background, cell modeling and system identification requirements, and the final solution, together with results. In order to use EKF to estimate the desired quantities, we first require a mathematical model that can accurately capture the dynamics of a cell. In this paper we “evolve” a suitable model from one that is very primitive to one that is more advanced and works well in practice. The final model includes terms that describe the dynamic contributions due to open-circuit voltage, ohmic loss, polarization time constants, electro-chemical hysteresis, and the effects of temperature. We also give a means, based on EKF, whereby the constant model parameters may be determined from cell test data. Results are presented that demonstrate it is possible to achieve root-mean-squared modeling error smaller than the level of quantization error expected in an implementation.},

abstract = {The design of a simplified yet accurate physics-based battery model enables researchers to accelerate the processes of the battery design, aging analysis and remaining useful life prediction. In order to reduce the computational complexity of the Pseudo Two-Dimensional mathematical model without sacrificing the accuracy, this paper proposes a simplified multi-particle model via a predictor-corrector strategy and quasi-linearization. In this model, a predictor-corrector strategy is used for updating two internal states, especially used for solving the electrolyte concentration approximation to reduce the computational complexity and reserve a high accuracy of the approximation. Quasi-linearization is applied to the approximations of the Butler-Volmer kinetics equation and the pore wall flux distribution to predict the non-uniform electrochemical reaction effects without using any nonlinear iterative solver. Simulation and experimental results show that the isothermal model and the model coupled with thermal behavior are greatly improve the computational efficiency with almost no loss of accuracy.},

abstract = {Advanced battery management systems (BMS) in electric vehicles (EVs) require immediate and accurate battery state, such as State-of-Charge (SoC) and State-of-Health (SoH) for efficient monitoring and control. To improve the state estimation performance of battery, an electrochemical model is applied in this paper. First, the electrochemical model is reduced to describe the instantaneous Li-ion concentration dynamics of each electrode sufficiently without main information loss. Second, two separate sliding mode observers (SMOs) combined with reduced order electrochemical model are designed to identify SoC/SoH of lithium-ion cell from external measured voltage and current value. An estimation scheme which is comprised of two subestimators is designed. They work jointly: one separate sliding mode observer (SMO) for SoC estimation using Li-ion solid-electrolyte concentration and the other observer for cell contact resistance adopting Lyapunov's stability theory. Finally, in order to demonstrate the performance of proposed scheme, the simulations are verified by experiments from a 2.3Ah high-power LiFePO4/graphite cell used in EVs. The results indicate that the proposed estimation scheme with the SMO algorithm performs well with initial error values. The maximum SoC and SoH estimation error are less than 3{\%} and 2.5{\%} under Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule (UDDS) drive cycles.},

An approximate solution method for the diffusion of lithium ions within active material particles is formulated using the finite element method and implemented in the previously developed 1D electrochemical model as an explicit difference equation. Reaction current distribution and redistribution processes occurring during discharge and current interrupt, respectively, are driven by gradients in equilibrium potential that arise due to solid diffusion limitations. The model is extrapolated to predict voltage response at discharge rates up to 40C where end of discharge is caused by negative electrode active material surface concentrations near depletion. Simple expressions are derived from an analytical solution to describe solid-state diffusion limited current for short duration, high-rate pulses.},

abstract = {Robust algorithms using reduced order equivalent circuit model (ECM) for an accurate and reliable estimation of battery states in various applications become more popular. In this study, a novel adaptive, self-learning heuristic algorithm for on-board impedance parameters and voltage estimation of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) in electric vehicles is introduced. The presented approach is verified using LIBs with different composition of chemistries (NMC/C, NMC/LTO, LFP/C) at different aging states. An impedance-based reduced order ECM incorporating ohmic resistance and a combination of a constant phase element and a resistance (so-called ZARC-element) is employed. Existing algorithms in vehicles are much more limited in the complexity of the ECMs. The algorithm is validated using seven day real vehicle data with high temperature variation including very low temperatures (from −20 °C to +30 °C) at different Depth-of-Discharges (DoDs). Two possibilities to approximate both ZARC-elements with finite number of RC-elements on-board are shown and the results of the voltage estimation are compared. Moreover, the current dependence of the charge-transfer resistance is considered by employing Butler–Volmer equation. Achieved results indicate that both models yield almost the same grade of accuracy.},

abstract = {In this paper, a reduced-order electrochemical model of lithium-ion batteries is developed for control and estimation applications through analytical model order reduction based on a Galerkin projection method. The governing diffusion partial differential equations in the liquid and solid phases are approximated into low-order systems of ordinary differential equations while the physical meaning of all model parameters is preserved, allowing one to perform state and parameter estimation. The selection of basis functions for the Galerkin projection method and model order truncation is carefully determined based on analysis both in the frequency and time domains. With the reduced-order diffusion models in the liquid and solid phases, an extended single particle model incorporating the electrolyte dynamics is developed. The model is then validated against the experimental data gathered from two batteries with different chemistries (lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide/graphite and lithium iron phosphate oxide/graphite) at different input conditions. Results show that the reduced-order model agrees very well with experimental data at various conditions. Meanwhile, it can be simulated thousands of times faster than the real time, making it suitable for long-term-life simulation, control, and estimation applications.},

abstract = {State of Health (SOH) estimation of lithium ion batteries is critical for Battery Management Systems (BMSs) in Electric Vehicles (EVs). Many estimation techniques utilize a battery model; however, the model must have high accuracy and high computational efficiency. Conventional electrochemical full-order models can accurately capture battery states, but they are too complex and computationally expensive to be used in a BMS. A Single Particle (SP) model is a good alternative that addresses this issue; however, existing SP models do not consider degradation physics. In this work, an SP-based degradation model is developed by including Solid Electrolyte Interface (SEI) layer formation, coupled with crack propagation due to the stress generated by the volume expansion of the particles in the active materials. A model of lithium ion loss from SEI layer formation is integrated with an advanced SP model that includes electrolytic physics. This low-order model quickly predicts capacity fade and voltage profile changes as a function of cycle number and temperature with high accuracy, allowing for the use of online estimation techniques. Lithium ion loss due to SEI layer formation, increase in battery resistance, and changes in the electrodes' open circuit potential operating windows are examined to account for capacity fade and power loss. In addition to the low-order implementation to facilitate on-line estimation, the model proposed in this paper provides quantitative information regarding SEI layer formation and crack propagation, as well as the resulting battery capacity fade and power dissipation, which are essential for SOH estimation in a BMS.},

Unidirectional charging limits hardware requirements and simplifies interconnection issues.Bidi- rectional charging supports battery energy injection back to the grid. Typical on-board chargers restrict power because of weight, space, and cost constraints. They can be integrated with the elec- tric drive to avoid these problems. The availability of charging infrastructure reduces on-board energy storage requirements and costs. On-board charger systems can be conductive or inductive. An off-board charger can be designed for high charging rates and is less constrained by size and weight. Level 1 (convenience),Level 2 (primary), and Level 3 (fast) power levels are discussed. Future as- pects such as roadbed charging are presented.

The model performance has been verified under pulse charge/discharge and dynamic stress test (DST) profiles with the standard derivation less than 0.021 V and the runtime 50 times faster. (2) the parametric relationship between the equivalent circuit model and simplified electrochemical model has been established, which will enhance the comprehension level of two models with more in-depth physical significance and provide new methods for electrochemical model parameter estimation. (3) four simplified electrochemical model parameters: equivalent resistance Req, effective diffusion coefficient in electrolyte phase Deeff, electrolyte phase volume fraction $\epsilon$ and open circuit voltage (OCV), have been identified by the recursive least square (RLS) algorithm with the modified DST profiles under 45, 25 and 0 °C. The simulation results indicate that the proposed model coupled with RLS algorithm can achieve high accuracy for electrochemical parameter identification in dynamic scenarios.},

@article{Zou2016,
abstract = {The accurate online state estimation for some types of nonlinear singularly perturbed systems is challenging due to extensive computational requirements, ill-conditioned gains and/or convergence issues. This paper proposes a multi-time-scale estimation algorithm for a class of nonlinear systems with coupled fast and slow dynamics. Based on a boundary-layer model and a reduced model, a multi-time-scale estimator is proposed in which the design parameter sets can be tuned in different time-scales. Stability property of the estimation errors is analytically characterized by adopting a deterministic version of extended Kalman filter (EKF). This proposed algorithm is applied to estimator design for the state-of-charge (SOC) and state-of-health (SOH) in a lithium-ion battery using the developed reduced order battery models. Simulation results on a high fidelity lithium-ion battery model demonstrate that the observer is effective in estimating SOC and SOH despite a range of common errors due to model order reductions, linearisation, initialisation and noisy measurement.},

abstract = {This study includes analysis of encapsulation materials from lithium-ion pouch cells and water vapour transmission rate (WVTR) measurements. WVTR measurements are performed on both fresh and environmentally stressed lithium-ion pouch cells. Capacity measurements are performed on both the fresh and the environmentally stressed battery cells to identify possible influences on electrochemical performance. Preparation of the battery cells prior to WVTR measurements includes opening of battery cells and extraction of electrode material, followed by resealing the encapsulations and adhesively mounting of gas couplings. A model describing the water diffusion through the thermal welds of the encapsulation are set up based on material analysis of the encapsulation material. Two WVTR equipments with different type of detectors are evaluated in this study. The results from the WVTR measurements show how important it is to perform this type of studies in dry environment and apply a rigorous precondition sequence before testing. Results from modelling confirm that the WVTR method has potential to be used for measurements of water diffusion into lithium-ion pouch cells. Consequently, WVTR measurements should be possible to use as a complement or alternative method to for example Karl Fisher titration.},

abstract = {A detailed three-dimensional thermal model has been developed to examine the thermal behaviour of a lithium-ion battery. This model precisely considers the layered-structure of the cell stacks, the case of a battery pack, and the gap between both elements to achieve a comprehensive analysis. Both location-dependent convection and radiation are adopted at boundaries to reflect different heat dissipation performances on all surfaces. Furthermore, a simplified thermal model is proposed according to the examination of various simplification strategies and validation from the detailed thermal model. Based on the examination, the calculation speed of the simplified model is comparable with that of a one-dimensional model with a maximum error less than 0.54K. These models successfully describe asymmetric temperature distribution inside a battery, and they predict an anomaly of temperature distribution on the surface if a metal case is used. Based on the simulation results from the detailed thermal model, radiation could contribute 43-63{\%} at most to the overall heat dissipation under natural convection. Forced convection is effective in depressing the maximum temperature, and the temperature uniformity does not necessarily decrease infinitely when the extent of forced convection is enhanced. The metal battery case serves as a heat spreader, and the contact layer provides extra thermal resistance and heat capacity for the system. These factors are important and should be considered seriously in the design of battery systems.},

abstract = {Silicon is considered one of the most promising anode materials for next-generation lithium-ion batteries. However, dramatic volume expansion during the lithiation of silicon complicates its practical implementation. Literature reports nanostructured electrodes, which are capable to accommodate the volume expansion, reducing associated swelling, degradation and capacity fading. However, several phenomena associated with the volume expansion, such as the reduction of the electrode's porosity, are inherent to the system and must be carefully considered for targeted engineering of high-energy lithium-ion batteries. Herein, we determine design criteria of silicon based electrodes, taking into account the volume expansion during lithiation. A “deformation threshold” is defined signifying the minimum value of the initial porosity that must be adjusted to avoid plastic deformation and dramatic reduction of the electrode's porosity during charging. In addition, a “C-rate threshold” is defined, guaranteeing diffusion limited currents not falling below a desired discharge rate. The impact of these theoretical limitations on the electrochemical performance of silicon-based electrodes is analyzed from an engineering point of view. The derived relations are used to optimize the electrode design parameters regarding maximum gravimetric and volumetric capacity.},

abstract = {One approach to creating physics-based reduced-order models (ROMs) of battery-cell dynamics requires first generating linearized Laplace-domain transfer functions of all cell internal electrochemical variables of interest. Then, the resulting infinite-dimensional transfer functions can be reduced by various means in order to find an approximate low-dimensional model. These methods include Pad{\'{e}} approximation or the Discrete-Time Realization algorithm. In a previous article, Lee and colleagues developed a transfer function of the electrolyte concentration for a porous-electrode pseudo-two-dimensional lithium-ion cell model. Their approach used separation of variables and Sturm–Liouville theory to compute an infinite-series solution to the transfer function, which they then truncated to a finite number of terms for reasons of practicality. Here, we instead use a variation-of-parameters approach to arrive at a different representation of the identical solution that does not require a series expansion. The primary benefits of the new approach are speed of computation of the transfer function and the removal of the requirement to approximate the transfer function by truncating the number of terms evaluated. Results show that the speedup of the new method can be more than 3800.},

One of their main disadvantages, when compared to equivalent circuit models, is the fact that they rely on numerous parameters. The identification of these parameters is difficult and usually needs the tear-down of the cell and detailed electrochemical analyses. In this work, we address this issue by developing a novel non-invasive procedure for the parameter identification of a single-particle model (SPM) of a Li-ion cell. The main contributions are: (i) the reformulation of the SPM in order to achieve a minimum number of grouped parameters to be identified; (ii) the formulation of a series of experimental tests capable to identify individually and non-invasively given subsets of these parameters. Notably, we craft specific tests to identify separately the parameters related to equilibrium, intercalation and diffusive phenomena that occur within the cell; (iii) the validation of the reformulated SPM and the associated parameter identification procedure through comparison of simulation results with both synthetic and experimental data. The former are obtained from a detailed pseudo-2-dimensional (P2D) model of a MCMB-LiCoO2 cell. The latter are obtained through experimental tests performed on a Lithium-titanate cell. Both are cycled with current profiles representative of power-grid and electric-vehicles (EVs) operating conditions. For these profiles, the model identified versus synthetic data achieves a root-mean-square error lower than 0.3{\%} on the cell states and lower than 0.75{\%} on the cell voltage. The model identified versus experimental data achieves a root-mean-square error on cell voltage lower than 1{\%}.},

@article{Sendek2017,
abstract = {We present a new type of large-scale computational screening approach for identifying promising candidate materials for solid state electrolytes for lithium ion batteries that is capable of screening all known lithium containing solids. To be useful for batteries, high performance solid state electrolyte materials must satisfy many requirements at once, an optimization that is difficult to perform experimentally or with computationally expensive ab initio techniques. We first screen 12831 lithium containing crystalline solids for those with high structural and chemical stability, low electronic conductivity, and low cost. We then develop a data-driven ionic conductivity classification model using logistic regression for identifying which candidate structures are likely to exhibit fast lithium conduction based on experimental measurements reported in the literature. The screening reduces the list of candidate materials from 12831 down to 21 structures that show promise as electrolytes, few of which have been examined experimentally. We discover that none of our simple atomistic descriptor functions alone provide predictive power for ionic conductivity, but a multi-descriptor model can exhibit a useful degree of predictive power. We also find that screening for structural stability, chemical stability and low electronic conductivity eliminates 92.2{\%} of all Li-containing materials and screening for high ionic conductivity eliminates a further 93.3{\%} of the remainder. Our screening utilizes structures and electronic information contained in the Materials Project database.},

abstract = {As lithium ion cells age, they experience power and energy fade associated with impedance rise and capacity loss, respectively. Identification of key aging parameters in lithium ion battery models can validate degradation hypotheses and provide a foundation for State of Health (SOH) estimation. This paper develops and simplifies an electrochemical model that depends on two key aging parameters, cell resistance and the solid phase diffusion time of Li+ species in the positive electrode. Off-line linear least squares and on-line adaptive gradient update processing of voltage and current data from fresh and aged lithium ion cells produce estimates of these aging parameters. These estimated parameters vary monotonically with age, consistent with accepted degradation mechanisms such as solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer growth and contact loss.},

abstract = {This paper investigates the state estimation of a high-fidelity spatially resolved thermal-electrochemical lithium-ion battery model commonly referred to as the pseudo two-dimensional model. The partial-differential algebraic equations (PDAEs) constituting the model are spatially discretised using Chebyshev orthogonal collocation enabling fast and accurate simulations up to high C-rates. This implementation of the pseudo-2D model is then used in combination with an extended Kalman filter algorithm for differential-algebraic equations to estimate the states of the model. The state estimation algorithm is able to rapidly recover the model states from current, voltage and temperature measurements. Results show that the error on the state estimate falls below 1{\%} in less than 200 s despite a 30{\%} error on battery initial state-of-charge and additive measurement noise with 10 mV and 0.5 K standard deviations.},

abstract = {This paper investigates the identifiability and estimation of the parameters of the single particle model (SPM) for lithium-ion battery simulation. Identifiability is addressed both in principle and in practice. The approach begins by grouping parameters and partially non-dimensionalising the SPM to determine the maximum expected degrees of freedom in the problem. We discover that, excluding open circuit voltage, there are only six independent parameters. We then examine the structural identifiability by considering whether the transfer function of the linearised SPM is unique. It is found that the model is unique provided that the electrode open circuit voltage functions have a known non-zero gradient, the parameters are ordered, and the electrode kinetics are lumped into a single charge transfer resistance parameter. We then demonstrate the practical estimation of model parameters from measured frequency-domain experimental electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data, and show additionally that the parametrised model provides good predictive capabilities in the time domain, exhibiting a maximum voltage error of 20 mV between model and experiment over a 10 minute dynamic discharge.},

The interactions among these subsystems require a holistic understanding of the system architecture, control, power electronics, and their overall interaction with the electrical grid system. This review paper presents important aspects of a PV-grid integrated dc fast charger—with a special focus on the charging system components, architecture, operational modes, and control. These include the interaction between the PV power source, grid electricity, energy storage unit (ESU) and power electronics for the chargers. A considerable amount of discussion is also dedicated to battery management systems (BMS) and their mutual interactions in the control processes. For the power electronics, the paper evaluates soft switching non-isolated dc-to-dc power converter topologies that can be possibly used as future EV chargers. In addition to these, a brief discussion on the impact of the PV-grid charging on the ac grid and distribution system and their remedial measures are presented. Furthermore, the challenges in regard to the vehicle to grid (V2G) concept are also described. It is envisaged that the information provided in this paper would be useful as a one-stop document for engineers, researchers and others who require information related to the dc fast charging of EV that incorporates a renewable energy source.},
