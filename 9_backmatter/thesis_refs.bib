abstract = {The design of a simplified yet accurate physics-based battery model enables researchers to accelerate the processes of the battery design, aging analysis and remaining useful life prediction. In order to reduce the computational complexity of the Pseudo Two-Dimensional mathematical model without sacrificing the accuracy, this paper proposes a simplified multi-particle model via a predictor-corrector strategy and quasi-linearization. In this model, a predictor-corrector strategy is used for updating two internal states, especially used for solving the electrolyte concentration approximation to reduce the computational complexity and reserve a high accuracy of the approximation. Quasi-linearization is applied to the approximations of the Butler-Volmer kinetics equation and the pore wall flux distribution to predict the non-uniform electrochemical reaction effects without using any nonlinear iterative solver. Simulation and experimental results show that the isothermal model and the model coupled with thermal behavior are greatly improve the computational efficiency with almost no loss of accuracy.},

abstract = {The accurate online state estimation for some types of nonlinear singularly perturbed systems is challenging due to extensive computational requirements, ill-conditioned gains and/or convergence issues. This paper proposes a multi-time-scale estimation algorithm for a class of nonlinear systems with coupled fast and slow dynamics. Based on a boundary-layer model and a reduced model, a multi-time-scale estimator is proposed in which the design parameter sets can be tuned in different time-scales. Stability property of the estimation errors is analytically characterized by adopting a deterministic version of extended Kalman filter (EKF). This proposed algorithm is applied to estimator design for the state-of-charge (SOC) and state-of-health (SOH) in a lithium-ion battery using the developed reduced order battery models. Simulation results on a high fidelity lithium-ion battery model demonstrate that the observer is effective in estimating SOC and SOH despite a range of common errors due to model order reductions, linearisation, initialisation and noisy measurement.},

@article{Yuan2017a,
abstract = {To guarantee the safety, high efficiency and long lifetime for lithium-ion battery, an advanced battery management system requires a physics-meaningful yet computationally efficient battery model. The pseudo-two dimensional (P2D) electrochemical model can provide physical information about the lithium concentration and potential distributions across the cell dimension. However, the extensive computation burden caused by the temporal and spatial discretization limits its real-time application. In this research, we propose a new simplified electrochemical model (SEM) by modifying the boundary conditions for electrolyte diffusion equations, which significantly facilitates the analytical solving process. Then to obtain a reduced order transfer function, the Pad{\'{e}} approximation method is adopted to simplify the derived transcendental impedance solution. The proposed model with the reduced order transfer function can be briefly computable and preserve physical meanings through the presence of parameters such as the solid/electrolyte diffusion coefficients (Ds{\&}De) and particle radius. The simulation illustrates that the proposed simplified model maintains high accuracy for electrolyte phase concentration (Ce) predictions, saying 0.8{\%} and 0.24{\%} modeling error respectively, when compared to the rigorous model under 1C-rate pulse charge/discharge and urban dynamometer driving schedule (UDDS) profiles. Meanwhile, this simplified model yields significantly reduced computational burden, which benefits its real-time application.},

abstract = {The effectiveness factor problem for heat and mass transfer with chemical reaction in a catalyst pellet is solved with a new technique especially suited to situations corresponding to high Thiele modulus when the solution is confined to a thin boundary region near the catalyst surface. The method of orthogonal collocation on finite elements combines the rapid convergence of the orthogonal collocation method with the convenience associated with finite difference methods of locating grid points or elements where the solution is important or has large gradients. The efficiency of the method results from block LU decompositions employed in the iterative schemes devised. The method is applied to two problems to illustrate the rate of convergence, the efficiency (as expressed by error versus computation time curves), and the use of the residual for optimum location of the finite elements. Comparisons are also made to usual orthogonal collocation and finite difference methods.},

abstract = {The design of a lumped parameter battery model preserving physical meaning is especially desired by the automotive researchers and engineers due to the strong demand for battery system control, estimation, diagnosis and prognostics. In light of this, a novel simplified fractional order electrochemical model is developed for electric vehicle (EV) applications in this paper. In the model, a general fractional order transfer function is designed for the solid phase lithium ion diffusion approximation. The dynamic characteristics of the electrolyte concentration overpotential are approximated by a first-order resistance-capacitor transfer function in the electrolyte phase. The Ohmic resistances and electrochemical reaction kinetics resistance are simplified to a lumped Ohmic resistance parameter. Overall, the number of model parameters is reduced from 30 to 9, yet the accuracy of the model is still guaranteed. In order to address the dynamics of phase-change phenomenon in the active particle during charging and discharging, variable solid-state diffusivity is taken into consideration in the model. Also, the observability of the model is analyzed on two types of lithium ion batteries subsequently. Results show the fractional order model with variable solid-state diffusivity agrees very well with experimental data at various current input conditions and is suitable for electric vehicle applications.},

@article{Rodriguez2017,
abstract = {One approach to creating physics-based reduced-order models (ROMs) of battery-cell dynamics requires first generating linearized Laplace-domain transfer functions of all cell internal electrochemical variables of interest. Then, the resulting infinite-dimensional transfer functions can be reduced by various means in order to find an approximate low-dimensional model. These methods include Pad{\'{e}} approximation or the Discrete-Time Realization algorithm. In a previous article, Lee and colleagues developed a transfer function of the electrolyte concentration for a porous-electrode pseudo-two-dimensional lithium-ion cell model. Their approach used separation of variables and Sturm–Liouville theory to compute an infinite-series solution to the transfer function, which they then truncated to a finite number of terms for reasons of practicality. Here, we instead use a variation-of-parameters approach to arrive at a different representation of the identical solution that does not require a series expansion. The primary benefits of the new approach are speed of computation of the transfer function and the removal of the requirement to approximate the transfer function by truncating the number of terms evaluated. Results show that the speedup of the new method can be more than 3800.},

abstract = {A low-order battery model has been developed that incorporates stress-enhanced diffusion and electrolyte concentration distribution into a modified single particle model. This model addresses two important challenges of battery modeling for Battery Management Systems: accuracy and computational efficiency. The developed model improves accuracy by including the potential drop in the electrolyte based on the predicted li-ion concentration profile along the entire electrode thickness, and by including the enhanced diffusivity due to diffusion-induced stress. Incorporating analytical solutions into a conventional single particle model eliminates the need to sacrifice calculation efficiency. The voltage prediction by the proposed model is more accurate than the conventional single particle model. Compared to complex physics-based battery models, the proposed model significantly improves the computational efficiency of various discharge scenarios, including constant current, the Dynamic Stress Test, and the Highway Fuel Economy Test. Integrating mechanical responses into the single particle model not only increases model accuracy, but also makes it applicable to models for next-generation high energy density materials where mechanical volume changes are important.

abstract = {In this paper, a reduced-order electrochemical model of lithium-ion batteries is developed for control and estimation applications through analytical model order reduction based on a Galerkin projection method. The governing diffusion partial differential equations in the liquid and solid phases are approximated into low-order systems of ordinary differential equations while the physical meaning of all model parameters is preserved, allowing one to perform state and parameter estimation. The selection of basis functions for the Galerkin projection method and model order truncation is carefully determined based on analysis both in the frequency and time domains. With the reduced-order diffusion models in the liquid and solid phases, an extended single particle model incorporating the electrolyte dynamics is developed. The model is then validated against the experimental data gathered from two batteries with different chemistries (lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide/graphite and lithium iron phosphate oxide/graphite) at different input conditions. Results show that the reduced-order model agrees very well with experimental data at various conditions. Meanwhile, it can be simulated thousands of times faster than the real time, making it suitable for long-term-life simulation, control, and estimation applications.},

In addition, based on the Moment approach, a novel scheme of inversion of the nonlinear output mapping of the Single Particle Model is presented. The effectiveness of this approach is illustrated by numerical simulations.},

abstract = {Advanced battery management systems (BMS) in electric vehicles (EVs) require immediate and accurate battery state, such as State-of-Charge (SoC) and State-of-Health (SoH) for efficient monitoring and control. To improve the state estimation performance of battery, an electrochemical model is applied in this paper. First, the electrochemical model is reduced to describe the instantaneous Li-ion concentration dynamics of each electrode sufficiently without main information loss. Second, two separate sliding mode observers (SMOs) combined with reduced order electrochemical model are designed to identify SoC/SoH of lithium-ion cell from external measured voltage and current value. An estimation scheme which is comprised of two subestimators is designed. They work jointly: one separate sliding mode observer (SMO) for SoC estimation using Li-ion solid-electrolyte concentration and the other observer for cell contact resistance adopting Lyapunov's stability theory. Finally, in order to demonstrate the performance of proposed scheme, the simulations are verified by experiments from a 2.3Ah high-power LiFePO4/graphite cell used in EVs. The results indicate that the proposed estimation scheme with the SMO algorithm performs well with initial error values. The maximum SoC and SoH estimation error are less than 3{\%} and 2.5{\%} under Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule (UDDS) drive cycles.},

The model involves only three parameters and a polynomial that fits the open circuit voltage of the battery. A method to estimate the model parameters and the polynomial is proposed. A single discharge test (constituted of several discharge steps) is required to operate the parameter estimation method.

abstract = {This paper investigates the identifiability and estimation of the parameters of the single particle model (SPM) for lithium-ion battery simulation. Identifiability is addressed both in principle and in practice. The approach begins by grouping parameters and partially non-dimensionalising the SPM to determine the maximum expected degrees of freedom in the problem. We discover that, excluding open circuit voltage, there are only six independent parameters. We then examine the structural identifiability by considering whether the transfer function of the linearised SPM is unique. It is found that the model is unique provided that the electrode open circuit voltage functions have a known non-zero gradient, the parameters are ordered, and the electrode kinetics are lumped into a single charge transfer resistance parameter. We then demonstrate the practical estimation of model parameters from measured frequency-domain experimental electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data, and show additionally that the parametrised model provides good predictive capabilities in the time domain, exhibiting a maximum voltage error of 20 mV between model and experiment over a 10 minute dynamic discharge.},

abstract = {Over the last decade, many efforts have been deployed to develop models for the prediction, the control, the optimization and the parameter estimation of Lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries. It appears that the most successful electrochemical-based model for Li-ion battery is the Pseudo-two-Dimensional model (P2D). Due to the fact that the governing equations are complex, this model cannot be used in real-time applications like Battery Management Systems (BMSs). To remedy the situation, several investigations have been carried out to simplify the P2D model. Mathematical and physical techniques are employed to reduce the order of magnitude of the P2D governing equations. The present paper is a review of the studies on the modeling of Li-ion batteries with simplified P2D models. The assumptions on which these models rest are stated, the calculation methods are examined, the advantages and the drawbacks of the models are discussed and their applications are presented. Suggestions for overcoming the shortcomings of the models are made. Challenges and future directions in the modeling of Li-ion batteries are also discussed.},

abstract = {Increased driving range and enhanced fast charging capabilities are two immediate goals of transport electrifi cation. However, these are of competing nature, leading to increased energy and power demand respectively from the on-board battery pack. By fi ne-tuning the number of layers versus active electrode material of a lithium ion pouch cell, tailored designs targeting either of these goals can be obtained. Achieving this trade-off through iterative empirical testing of layer choices is expensive and often produces sub-optimal designs. This paper presents a model-based methodology for determining the optimal number of layers, maximising usable energy whilst satisfying specifi c acceleration and fast charging targets. The proposed methodology accounts for the critical need to avoid lithium plating during fast charging and searches for the optimal layer confi guration considering a range of thermal conditions. A numerical implementation of a cell model using a hybrid fi nite volume-spectral scheme is presented, wherein the model equations are suitably reformulated to directly accept power inputs, facilitating rapid and accurate searching of the layer design space. We show how thermal management design can limit vehicle driving range at high charging temperatures. We highlight how electrode materials exhibiting increased solid phase diffusion rates are as equally important for extended range as developing new materials with higher inherent capacity. We illustrate for a plug-in hybrid vehicle, how the proposed methodology facilitates common module design of battery packs, thereby reducing the cost of derivative vehicle models. To facilitate model based layer optimisation, we provide the open-source toolbox, BOLD (Battery Optimal Layer Design).},

Second, the discrete state-space equations of the impedance model are inferred by Gr{\"{u}}nwald-Letnikov definition and parameters of the model including the order of the fractional element are identified together by genetic algorithm (GA) and the experiment data of the dynamic driving cycles. Third, the fractional order unscented Kalman filter technique is presented and the ‘short memory' technique is employed to improve the computation efficiency of fractional operator. Lastly, experimental validation is implemented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach and results show that the SoC estimation accuracy can be improved by the proposed model and estimation method.

abstract = {This book is a pedagogical presentation of the application of spectral and pseudospectral methods to kinetic theory and quantum mechanics. There are additional applications to astrophysics, engineering, biology and many other fields. The main objective of this book is to provide the basic concepts to enable the use of spectral and pseudospectral methods to solve problems in diverse fields of interest and to a wide audience. While spectral methods are generally based on Fourier Series or Chebychev polynomials, non-classical polynomials and associated quadratures are used for many of the applications presented in the book. Fourier series methods are summarized with a discussion of the resolution of the Gibbs phenomenon. Classical and non-classical quadratures are used for the evaluation of integrals in reaction dynamics including nuclear fusion, radial integrals in density functional theory, in elastic scattering theory and other applications. The subject matter includes the calculation of transport coefficients in gases and other gas dynamical problems based on spectral and pseudospectral solutions of the Boltzmann equation. Radiative transfer in astrophysics and atmospheric science, and applications to space physics are discussed. The relaxation of initial non-equilibrium distributions to equilibrium for several different systems is studied with the Boltzmann and Fokker-Planck equations. The eigenvalue spectra of the linear operators in the Boltzmann, Fokker-Planck and Schrödinger equations are studied with spectral and pseudospectral methods based on non-classical orthogonal polynomials. The numerical methods referred to as the Discrete Ordinate Method, Differential Quadrature, the Quadrature Discretization Method, the Discrete Variable Representation, the Lagrange Mesh Method, and others are discussed and compared. MATLAB codes are provided for most of the numerical results reported in the book.

abstract = {In a previous paper, we developed a method to produce a physics-based one-dimensional discrete-time state-space reduced-order model (ROM) of a lithium-ion cell. The method relies on linearizing the standard porous-electrode equations around a fixed state-of-charge (SOC) and operating temperature setpoint. The ROM is able to track a highly dynamic input accurately near the linearization setpoint, but its performance degrades as either the cell's SOC or temperature move away from this linearization point. This paper describes a way to extend the accuracy of the ROM over a wide range of SOCs and temperatures using a model-blending approach. Our results demonstrate that the approach accurately models the cell's voltage and internal electrochemical variables over a wide range of temperature and SOC, with little added computational complexity. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Model-order reduction and minimization of the CPU run-time while maintaining the model accuracy are critical requirements for real-time implementation of lithium-ion electrochemical battery models. In this paper, an isothermal, continuous, piecewise-linear, electrode-average model is developed by using an optimal knot placement technique. The proposed model reduces the univariate nonlinear function of the electrode's open circuit potential dependence on the state of charge to continuous piecewise regions. The parameterization experiments were chosen to provide a trade-off between extensive experimental characterization techniques and purely identifying all parameters using optimization techniques. The model is then parameterized in each continuous, piecewise-linear, region. Applying the proposed technique cuts down the CPU run-time by around 20{\%}, compared to the reduced-order, electrode-average model. Finally, the model validation against real-time driving profiles (FTP-72, WLTP) demonstrates the ability of the model to predict the cell voltage accurately with less than 2{\%} error.},

One of the most critical tasks of a BMS is state of charge (SoC) estimation. In this paper, an efficient electrochemical model-based SoC estimation algorithm is presented. The use of electrochemical models enables an accurate estimation of the SoC as well during high current events. However, this often due to the cost of a high computational complexity. In this paper, it is shown that by writing the model as a linearly spatially interconnected system and by exploiting the resulting semi-separable structure an efficient extended Kalman filter (EKF) can be implemented. The proposed EKF is compared with another electrochemical-based estimation and shown to deliver an estimation error of less than 5{\%} also during high current peak.},

This implementation of the pseudo-2D model is then used in combination with an extended Kalman filter algorithm for differential-algebraic equations to estimate the states of the model. The state estimation algorithm is able to rapidly recover the model states from current, voltage and temperature measurements.

@article{Chaturvedi2010,
abstract = {Lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries are ubiquitous sources of energy for portable electronic devices. Compared to alternative battery technologies, Li-ion batteries provide one of the best energy-to-weight ratios, exhibit no memory effect, and have low self-discharge when not in use. These beneficial properties, as well as decreasing costs, have established Li-ion batteries as a leading candidate for the next generation of automotive and aerospace applications. In the automotive sector, increasing demand for hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), plug-in HEVs (PHEVs), and EVs has pushed manufacturers to the limits of contemporary automotive battery technology. This limitation is gradually forcing consideration of alternative battery technologies, such as Li-ion batteries, as a replacement for existing leadacid and nickel-metal-hydride batteries. Unfortunately, this replacement is a challenging task since automotive applications demand large amounts of energy and power and must operate safely, reliably, and durably at these scales. The article presents a detailed description and model of a Li-ion battery. It begins the section "Intercalation-Based Batteries" by providing an intuitive explanation of the fundamentals behind storing energy in a Li-ion battery. In the sections "Modeling Approach" and "Li-Ion Battery Model," it present equations that describe a Li-ion cell's dynamic behavior. This modeling is based on using electrochemical principles to develop a physics-based model in contrast to equivalent circuit models. A goal of this article is to present the electrochemical model from a controls perspective.},

We present here an analytical impedance model of the metal hydride electrode. This simple model is used to calculate the diffusion coefficient of hydrogen in the metal alloy. The impedance response of cobalt microencapsulated LaNi4.27Sn0.24 electrode was measured at different hydrogen contents. From the slope of the Nyquist plot in the transition region the diffusion coefficient of hydrogen was calculated at various states of charge (SOC). It is seen that the diffusion coefficient increases with the hydrogen content in the alloy. The technique applied for cobalt encapsulated LaNi4.27Sn0.24 could however be used for any hydrogen storage alloy.},

This paper presents a novel approach to the design and parametrization of a reduced-order model characterizing the dynamic voltage response of a Li-ion cell. The model is based on the assumption of uniform active material utilization and includes prediction of the ionic concentration and potential dynamics in the liquid phase, which significantly affects the voltage response for high currents. A model-order reduction procedure based on the Pade approximation method is used to reduce the partial differential equation model to a low-order system of ordinary differential equations. Systematic methods are proposed to identify the electrochemical parameters that govern power and capacity prediction, as well as their temperature dependence. The procedure is based on carefully designed experiments that isolate the influence of small groups of parameters on the voltage output, utilizing complete cell data for model identification almost entirely in place of half-cell characterization. Finally, an extensive validation with experimental data illustrates the ability of the model to accurately predict the cell voltage.},

abstract = {We present a method to produce a physics-based one-dimensional discrete-time state-space reduced-order model (ROM) of a lithium-ion cell. The resulting ROM can predict the five variables of a standard porous-electrode model—reaction flux, solid and electrolyte lithium concentration, and solid and electrolyte potentials—at any location across the cell cross section, as well as cell terminal voltage. The method to generate the model involves first linearizing the porous-electrode-model equations, and then deriving closed-form Laplace-domain transfer functions from the linearized equations. Next, the discrete-time realization algorithm (DRA) is used to convert the transfer functions into an optimal discrete-time state-space realization. Advantages of this approach include that the DRA avoids nonlinear optimization and gives a straightforward method for selecting the system order for the ROM. Simulation results demonstrate that the ROM cell voltage predictions and the ROM internal electrochemical variable predictions match very closely with results obtained by simulating the full nonlinear porous-electrode partial differential equations.},

Real-time electrochemical state information enables high-fidelity monitoring and high-performance operation in advanced battery management systems, for applications such as consumer electronics, electrified vehicles, and grid energy storage. This paper derives a single particle model (SPM) with electrolyte that achieves higher predictive accuracy than the SPM. Next, we propose an estimation scheme and prove estimation error system stability, assuming that the total amount of lithium in the cell is known. The state estimation scheme exploits the dynamical properties, such as marginal stability, local invertibility, and conservation of lithium.

abstract = {Lithium ion (Li-ion) batteries provide high energy and power density energy storage for diverse applications ranging from cell phones to hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs). For efficient and reliable systems integration, low order dynamic battery models are needed. This paper introduces a general method to generate numerically a fully observable/controllable state variable model from electrochemical kinetic, species and charge partial differential equations that govern the discharge/charge behavior of a Li-ion battery. Validated against a 313th order nonlinear CFD model of a 6Ah HEV cell, a 12th order state variable model predicts terminal voltage to within 1{\%} for pulse and constant current profiles at rates up to 50C. The state equation is constructed in modal form with constant negative real eigenvalues distributed in frequency space from 0 to 10Hz. Open circuit potential, electrode surface concentration/reaction distribution coupling and electrolyte concentration/ionic conductivity nonlinearities are explicitly approximated in the model output equation on a local, electrode-averaged and distributed basis, respectively. The balanced realization controllability/observability gramian indicates that the fast electrode surface concentration dynamics are more observable/controllable than the electrode bulk concentration dynamics (i.e. state of charge).},

A sensitivity analysis is performed to identify the most important parameters and variables in the model. To assess the loss of battery capacity through cycling, the reduction of the electrolyte (ethylene carbonate) is considered as a side reaction. The battery is cycled until the end-of-life conditions are met: EODV (end of discharge voltage) below 3V or capacity fading greater than 20{\%} of the initial capacity of the battery. A gradient-based optimization is performed, identifying the maximum number of cycles within the simulated conditions.

An improved pseudo two-dimension (P2D) model is established on basis of partial differential equations (PDEs), since the electrolyte potential is simplified from the nonlinear to linear expression while terminal voltage can be divided into the electrolyte potential, open circuit voltage (OCV), overpotential of electrodes, internal resistance drop, and so on. The model order reduction process is implemented by the simplification of the PDEs using the Laplace transform, inverse Laplace transform, Pade approximation, etc. A unified second order transfer function between cell voltage and current is obtained for the comparability with that of ECM. The final objective is to obtain the relationship between the ECM resistances/capacitances and electrochemical parameters such that in various conditions, ECM precision could be improved regarding integration of battery interior properties for further applications, e.g., SOC estimation. Finally simulation and experimental results prove the correctness and validity of the proposed methodology.},

To motivate the development of reduced order battery model, three major contributions have been made throughout this paper: (1) the transfer function type of simplified electrochemical model is proposed to address the current-voltage relationship with Pad{\'{e}} approximation method and modified boundary conditions for electrolyte diffusion equations. The model performance has been verified under pulse charge/discharge and dynamic stress test (DST) profiles with the standard derivation less than 0.021 V and the runtime 50 times faster. (2) the parametric relationship between the equivalent circuit model and simplified electrochemical model has been established, which will enhance the comprehension level of two models with more in-depth physical significance and provide new methods for electrochemical model parameter estimation. (3) four simplified electrochemical model parameters: equivalent resistance Req, effective diffusion coefficient in electrolyte phase Deeff, electrolyte phase volume fraction $\epsilon$ and open circuit voltage (OCV), have been identified by the recursive least square (RLS) algorithm with the modified DST profiles under 45, 25 and 0 °C. The simulation results indicate that the proposed model coupled with RLS algorithm can achieve high accuracy for electrochemical parameter identification in dynamic scenarios.},

In this study, a novel adaptive, self-learning heuristic algorithm for on-board impedance parameters and voltage estimation of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) in electric vehicles is introduced. The presented approach is verified using LIBs with different composition of chemistries (NMC/C, NMC/LTO, LFP/C) at different aging states. An impedance-based reduced order ECM incorporating ohmic resistance and a combination of a constant phase element and a resistance (so-called ZARC-element) is employed. Existing algorithms in vehicles are much more limited in the complexity of the ECMs. The algorithm is validated using seven day real vehicle data with high temperature variation including very low temperatures (from −20 °C to +30 °C) at different Depth-of-Discharges (DoDs). Two possibilities to approximate both ZARC-elements with finite number of RC-elements on-board are shown and the results of the voltage estimation are compared. Moreover, the current dependence of the charge-transfer resistance is considered by employing Butler–Volmer equation. Achieved results indicate that both models yield almost the same grade of accuracy.},

For rates higher than 1C, simplifications to the rigorous model are suggested that reduce the solution time for the model.},

abstract = {Physics-based model has been regarded as a promising alternative to equivalent circuit model due to its ability to describe internal electrochemical states of battery. However, the rigorous physics-based model, namely pseudo-two-dimensional (P2D) model, is too complicated for online application in embedded battery management system. In this paper, to simplify the P2D model, a series of polynomial functions are employed to approximate the electrolyte phase concentration profile, solid phase concentration profile, and non-uniform reaction flux profile, respectively. Especially, the accuracy of 2nd-order and 3rd-order polynomial approximations for reaction flux is compared, and the higher-order is validated with more strength. Benefit from the acquisition of above variables, the electrolyte potential is derived directly according to the conservation of charge at electrolyte phase; the accuracy of activation overpotential is also improved by using the non-uniform reaction flux rather than assuming the uniform current density in single particle (SP) model. Finally, the developed model is simulated by different constant current rates, hybrid pulse and driving cycles, and its outputs are compared with P2D model and original SP model. The results demonstrate that the model proposed in this paper could capture the battery characteristics efficiently, and also significantly reduce the computation complexity.},

@article{Namor2017,
abstract = {Physics-based models of electrochemical cells are of great interest for the future battery management systems (BMSs), due to their accuracy and capability to predict cell physical states. One of their main disadvantages, when compared to equivalent circuit models, is the fact that they rely on numerous parameters. The identification of these parameters is difficult and usually needs the tear-down of the cell and detailed electrochemical analyses. In this work, we address this issue by developing a novel non-invasive procedure for the parameter identification of a single-particle model (SPM) of a Li-ion cell. The main contributions are: (i) the reformulation of the SPM in order to achieve a minimum number of grouped parameters to be identified; (ii) the formulation of a series of experimental tests capable to identify individually and non-invasively given subsets of these parameters. Notably, we craft specific tests to identify separately the parameters related to equilibrium, intercalation and diffusive phenomena that occur within the cell; (iii) the validation of the reformulated SPM and the associated parameter identification procedure through comparison of simulation results with both synthetic and experimental data. The former are obtained from a detailed pseudo-2-dimensional (P2D) model of a MCMB-LiCoO2 cell. The latter are obtained through experimental tests performed on a Lithium-titanate cell. Both are cycled with current profiles representative of power-grid and electric-vehicles (EVs) operating conditions. For these profiles, the model identified versus synthetic data achieves a root-mean-square error lower than 0.3{\%} on the cell states and lower than 0.75{\%} on the cell voltage. The model identified versus experimental data achieves a root-mean-square error on cell voltage lower than 1{\%}.},

abstract = {Accurate diagnosis of lithium ion battery state-of-health (SOH) is of significant value for many applications, to improve performance, extend life and increase safety. However, in-situ or in-operando diagnosis of SOH often requires robust models. There are many models available however these often require expensive-to-measure ex-situ parameters and/or contain unmeasurable parameters that were fitted/assumed. In this work, we have developed a new empirically parameterised physics-informed equivalent circuit model. Its modular construction and low-cost parametrisation requirements allow end users to parameterise cells quickly and easily. The model is accurate to 19.6 mV for dynamic loads without any global fitting/optimisation, only that of the individual elements. The consequences of various degradation mechanisms are simulated, and the impact of a degraded cell on pack performance is explored, validated by comparison with experiment. Results show that an aged cell in a parallel pack does not have a noticeable effect on the available capacity of other cells in the pack. The model shows that cells perform better when electrodes are more porous towards the separator and have a uniform particle size distribution, validated by comparison with published data. The model is provided with this publication for readers to use.},

abstract = {The detailed isothermal electrochemical model for a lithium ion cell comprises of 10 coupled partial differential equations (PDEs). It is computationally intensive to use this model for detailed parameter estimation, battery packs, battery management system algorithms, calendar or cycle life predictions etc. This work describes a reduced order model framework, which reduces the detailed model PDEs, to a manageable set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs), which can be used for the above applications. Volume averaging PDEs yield ODEs. Hence volume averaging is the basic method used for model reduction. The gradient or profile information lost on volume averaging is recovered through profile based approximations. For the lowest order reduced order model (ROM), a uniform reaction rate, quadratic electrolyte concentrations and quartic solid phase concentrations are assumed. In this ROM only 5 linear ODEs are solved, and the rest are nonlinear algebraic evaluations. When compared with the detailed electrochemical model of a lithium ion cell, this ROM gives negligible error at nominal currents and a maximum error of about 3{\%} at high currents, for a typical commercial cell.},
