abstract = {State of Health (SOH) estimation of lithium ion batteries is critical for Battery Management Systems (BMSs) in Electric Vehicles (EVs). Many estimation techniques utilize a battery model; however, the model must have high accuracy and high computational efficiency. Conventional electrochemical full-order models can accurately capture battery states, but they are too complex and computationally expensive to be used in a BMS. A Single Particle (SP) model is a good alternative that addresses this issue; however, existing SP models do not consider degradation physics. In this work, an SP-based degradation model is developed by including Solid Electrolyte Interface (SEI) layer formation, coupled with crack propagation due to the stress generated by the volume expansion of the particles in the active materials. A model of lithium ion loss from SEI layer formation is integrated with an advanced SP model that includes electrolytic physics. This low-order model quickly predicts capacity fade and voltage profile changes as a function of cycle number and temperature with high accuracy, allowing for the use of online estimation techniques. Lithium ion loss due to SEI layer formation, increase in battery resistance, and changes in the electrodes' open circuit potential operating windows are examined to account for capacity fade and power loss. In addition to the low-order implementation to facilitate on-line estimation, the model proposed in this paper provides quantitative information regarding SEI layer formation and crack propagation, as well as the resulting battery capacity fade and power dissipation, which are essential for SOH estimation in a BMS.},

@article{Schmidt2010c,
abstract = {This paper presents a novel electrochemical lithium-ion cell model which can be used in battery control units. Based on classical single-particle approaches, a lumped-parameter nonlinear model is developed that is able to predict accurately the terminal voltages for arbitrary loads, and even for potentiostatic operation. The key points are: (1) an incorporation of the electrolyte potential, (2) a modal decomposition of the partial differential equation of the liquid phase lithium-ion concentration, (3) a correct handling of the SOC-dependent diffusivity in the insertion materials of both electrodes, and (4) a consideration of temperature-dependent kinetic processes. A combined parameter analysis and identification is successfully applied for the parameterization of the model. Using a Fisher-information matrix approach in combination with a sensitivity analysis, the identifiability of each parameter is estimated in dependence on the measurement information. Using this information, it is possible to choose a small number of relevant experiments which are sufficient to fully parameterize the model. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The single-particle model presented by Santhanagopalan et al. J. Power Sources, 156, 620 (2006) is extended to include an energy balance. The temperature dependence of the solid phase diffusion coefficient of the lithium in the intercalation particles, the electrochemical reaction rate constants, and the open circuit potentials (OCPs) of the positive and negative electrodes are included in the model. The solution phase polarization is approximated using a nonlinear resistance, which is a function of current and temperature. The model is used to predict the temperature and voltage profiles in a lithium-ion cell during galvanostatic operations. The single-particle thermal model is validated by comparing the simulated voltage and temperature profiles to the results obtained using a distributed porous electrode model. The simulation results from the single-particle thermal model also show good agreement with experimental voltage data obtained from lithium-ion pouch cells under different discharge rates (C/33, C/2 and C) at different temperatures (15, 25, 35, and 45C).},

@article{Yuan2017a,
abstract = {To guarantee the safety, high efficiency and long lifetime for lithium-ion battery, an advanced battery management system requires a physics-meaningful yet computationally efficient battery model. The pseudo-two dimensional (P2D) electrochemical model can provide physical information about the lithium concentration and potential distributions across the cell dimension. However, the extensive computation burden caused by the temporal and spatial discretization limits its real-time application. In this research, we propose a new simplified electrochemical model (SEM) by modifying the boundary conditions for electrolyte diffusion equations, which significantly facilitates the analytical solving process. Then to obtain a reduced order transfer function, the Pad{\'{e}} approximation method is adopted to simplify the derived transcendental impedance solution. The proposed model with the reduced order transfer function can be briefly computable and preserve physical meanings through the presence of parameters such as the solid/electrolyte diffusion coefficients (Ds{\&}De) and particle radius. The simulation illustrates that the proposed simplified model maintains high accuracy for electrolyte phase concentration (Ce) predictions, saying 0.8{\%} and 0.24{\%} modeling error respectively, when compared to the rigorous model under 1C-rate pulse charge/discharge and urban dynamometer driving schedule (UDDS) profiles. Meanwhile, this simplified model yields significantly reduced computational burden, which benefits its real-time application.},

abstract = {A real-time determination of battery parameters is challenging because batteries are non-linear, time-varying systems. The transient behaviour of lithium-ion batteries is modelled by a Thevenin-equivalent circuit with two time constants characterising activation and concentration polarization. An experimental approach is proposed for directly determining battery parameters as a function of physical quantities. The model's parameters are a function of the state of charge and of the discharge rate. These can be expressed by regression equations in the model to derive a continuous-discrete extended Kalman estimator of the state of charge and of other parameters. This technique is based on numerical integration of the ordinary differential equations to predict the state of the stochastic dynamic system and the corresponding error covariance matrix. Then a standard correction step of the extended Kalman filter (EKF) is applied to increase the accuracy of estimated parameters. Simulations resulting from this proposed estimator model were compared with experimental results under a variety of operating scenarios—analysis of the results demonstrate the accuracy of the estimator for correctly identifying battery parameters.},

abstract = {A new approximate physics-based Lithium-ion cell model is developed by extending the descriptions of the non-uniform reaction distribution effect and the electrolyte concentration/potential distribution effect into single particle model, namely the extended single particle model. In this model, the simplification of the solid-phase diffusion is based on the existing approximate solution where a polynomial is used to approximate the concentration profile inside the particle. Diffusion in the electrolyte and the concentration polarization effect are simplified using the approximate solution based on parabolic profile approximation for the electrolyte concentration distribution. Especially, this model analyzes the mathematical description of the non-uniform reaction distribution effect inside the electrode, and an approximate solution of this effect is obtained by synthetically applying the volume average technique, approximated by the uniform reaction distribution situation, exponential profile approximation and the iterative calculation techniques. Thus the description of the non-uniform reaction distribution effect is successfully extended and the pore wall fluxes at the two current collector interfaces can be accurately predicted. Simulation results show that this model greatly improves the computational efficiency with little loss of accuracy.},

abstract = {This paper investigates the identifiability and estimation of the parameters of the single particle model (SPM) for lithium-ion battery simulation. Identifiability is addressed both in principle and in practice. The approach begins by grouping parameters and partially non-dimensionalising the SPM to determine the maximum expected degrees of freedom in the problem. We discover that, excluding open circuit voltage, there are only six independent parameters. We then examine the structural identifiability by considering whether the transfer function of the linearised SPM is unique. It is found that the model is unique provided that the electrode open circuit voltage functions have a known non-zero gradient, the parameters are ordered, and the electrode kinetics are lumped into a single charge transfer resistance parameter. We then demonstrate the practical estimation of model parameters from measured frequency-domain experimental electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data, and show additionally that the parametrised model provides good predictive capabilities in the time domain, exhibiting a maximum voltage error of 20 mV between model and experiment over a 10 minute dynamic discharge.},

abstract = {Over the last decade, many efforts have been deployed to develop models for the prediction, the control, the optimization and the parameter estimation of Lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries. It appears that the most successful electrochemical-based model for Li-ion battery is the Pseudo-two-Dimensional model (P2D). Due to the fact that the governing equations are complex, this model cannot be used in real-time applications like Battery Management Systems (BMSs). To remedy the situation, several investigations have been carried out to simplify the P2D model. Mathematical and physical techniques are employed to reduce the order of magnitude of the P2D governing equations. The present paper is a review of the studies on the modeling of Li-ion batteries with simplified P2D models. The assumptions on which these models rest are stated, the calculation methods are examined, the advantages and the drawbacks of the models are discussed and their applications are presented. Suggestions for overcoming the shortcomings of the models are made. Challenges and future directions in the modeling of Li-ion batteries are also discussed.},

abstract = {A 1D electrochemical, lumped thermal model is used to explore pulse power limitations and thermal behavior of a 6Ah, 72 cell, 276V nominal Li-ion hybrid-electric vehicle (HEV) battery pack. Depleted/saturated active material Li surface concentrations in the negative/positive electrodes consistently cause end of high-rate (∼25C) pulse discharge at the 2.7Vcell−1 minimum limit, indicating solid-state diffusion is the limiting mechanism. The 3.9Vcell−1 maximum limit, meant to protect the negative electrode from lithium deposition side reaction during charge, is overly conservative for high-rate (∼15C) pulse charges initiated from states-of-charge (SOCs) less than 100{\%}. Two-second maximum pulse charge rate from the 50{\%} SOC initial condition can be increased by as much as 50{\%} without risk of lithium deposition. Controlled to minimum/maximum voltage limits, the pack meets partnership for next generation vehicles (PNGV) power assist mode pulse power goals (at operating temperatures {\textgreater}16°C), but falls short of the available energy goal. In a vehicle simulation, the pack generates heat at a 320W rate on a US06 driving cycle at 25°C, with more heat generated at lower temperatures. Less aggressive FUDS and HWFET cycles generate 6–12 times less heat. Contact resistance ohmic heating dominates all other mechanisms, followed by electrolyte phase ohmic heating. Reaction and electronic phase ohmic heats are negligible. A convective heat transfer coefficient of h=10.1Wm−2K−1 maintains cell temperature at or below the 52°C PNGV operating limit under aggressive US06 driving.},

abstract = {The design of predictive, electrochemical, Li-ion battery models and the use of model-order reduction techniques to extract low-order models enables researchers to address problems related to model-based control, estimation, aging, and life-cycle prediction. This paper presents a novel approach to the design and parametrization of a reduced-order model characterizing the dynamic voltage response of a Li-ion cell. The model is based on the assumption of uniform active material utilization and includes prediction of the ionic concentration and potential dynamics in the liquid phase, which significantly affects the voltage response for high currents. A model-order reduction procedure based on the Pade approximation method is used to reduce the partial differential equation model to a low-order system of ordinary differential equations. Systematic methods are proposed to identify the electrochemical parameters that govern power and capacity prediction, as well as their temperature dependence. The procedure is based on carefully designed experiments that isolate the influence of small groups of parameters on the voltage output, utilizing complete cell data for model identification almost entirely in place of half-cell characterization. Finally, an extensive validation with experimental data illustrates the ability of the model to accurately predict the cell voltage.},

abstract = {Increasing electrode thickness and loading can help Li-ion batteries achieve higher energy densities, but the resulting decay in electrochemical performance at elevated rates remains a significant challenge. In order to design an optimal thick electrode, understanding how performance loss occurs is necessary. While it is known that both ionic and electronic conductivity contribute to rate performance, we observed a stronger correlation between electronic conductivity and electrochemical performance of electrodes at a loading of {\textgreater}25 mg/cm2 under C/3 to 1C, rates most relevant to electric vehicle applications. To illustrate this effect, we explore the mud-cracking phenomenon during electrode fabrication to obtain narrow, vertical channels which reduce electrode tortuosity, and therefore decrease the liquid phase ionic resistance in thick electrodes. Variation in crack densities enables us to systematically investigate the effects of ionic and electronic conductivity on electrochemical performance in electrodes with identical overall porosity and composition. Rate and cycling performances of mud-cracked thick electrodes have stronger correlations with electronic conductivity than ionic conductivity. These findings shed new light on the relative importance of electronic versus ionic conductivities, arguing for the need to further optimize electronic conduction in thick electrodes when they are cycled in conditions relevant to electric vehicle applications.},

In this paper, an isothermal, continuous, piecewise-linear, electrode-average model is developed by using an optimal knot placement technique. The proposed model reduces the univariate nonlinear function of the electrode's open circuit potential dependence on the state of charge to continuous piecewise regions. The parameterization experiments were chosen to provide a trade-off between extensive experimental characterization techniques and purely identifying all parameters using optimization techniques. The model is then parameterized in each continuous, piecewise-linear, region. Applying the proposed technique cuts down the CPU run-time by around 20{\%}, compared to the reduced-order, electrode-average model. Finally, the model validation against real-time driving profiles (FTP-72, WLTP) demonstrates the ability of the model to predict the cell voltage accurately with less than 2{\%} error.},

@article{Kemper2015,
abstract = {A sophisticated BMS often requires an accurate yet simple battery model. Simplified models such as the single particle model (SPM), however, provide limited insight because lithium concentration variations over the cell thickness dimension are often neglected. In this study, we propose a simplified electrochemical model that, by reviving the lithium concentration variation across the cell thickness, provides significantly improved prediction power over the SPM. The lithium concentration profiles are first derived according to the electrochemistry-based pseudo-two dimensions (P2D) model under the steady-state assumption, they are then relaxed into a dynamic model. By employing steady-state concentration profiles coupled with averaged dynamics, the proposed model predicts electrolyte and solid surface concentrations (ce and css, respectively) and potential variations across the cell during both transients and stead-state conditions. The proposed model is validated by comparing the cell voltage, ce, and css concentration RMS errors with respect to the P2D model under pulse and constant current inputs. The simulation shows that the proposed model achieves at least 74{\%}, 77{\%}, and 65{\%} RMS error reductions for cell voltage, css and ce, respectively, when compared to SPM in constant current simulation. Finally, the presented model is used to predict and detect local lithium plating, which the SPM is not capable of doing; our method yields predictions similar to those of the original P2D model at computational loads comparable to SPM.},

@article{Choe2013,
abstract = {Comparably long charging time for battery of electric and hybrid vehicles is one of barriers for massive commercialization of the vehicles. Typical charging methods are by a constant current (CC) with constant voltage (CV), pulsed or tapered current. Theoretically, the charging time can be reduced by increased amplitude of the charging current, which, however, accelerate degradation of cells and reduces the lifespan. The relationship between the charging current and the degradation has not been well understood. Studies on ion transport and chemical reactions using a computational model developed in our laboratory reveal that a high charging current causes excessive ions at the surface of electrode particles because of slow diffusion process of ions in the solid electrodes. The excessive lithium ions react with electrons and form a thin layer, called Lithium plating that is irreversible. The Lithium plating not only reduces ion conductivities, but also contributes growth of dendrites and potentially internal short circuit. In this paper, a new charging algorithm is proposed that is based on an electrochemical and thermal model, which order is drastically reduced in order to facilitate a real time operation. The model, called Reduced Order of Electrochemical Thermal Model (ROM), is completely validated with a pouch type of Lithium polymer battery and used to dynamically estimate ion concentration at the surface of particles. Based on the estimated ion concentration, a new control algorithm is derived that allows for determination of amplitude and duration of the charging current. The ROM performs at least ten fold faster in calculations than the original full order model. The simulation and experimental results show that the charging time can be reduced to 60-70{\%} of that of the classical CC/CV charging by preventing excessive ions and slowing down degradation of cell capacity losses.},

abstract = {If electrode kinetics ape fast and concentration gradients can be ignored, the reaction in a battery electrode is confined to a narrow zone, which moves through the electrode as the battery is discharged. During this process, the ohmic resistance increases, and the cutoff potential may signal the end of the discharge. It is desirable to have a matching of the capacity of the electrode (and hence its thickness) with the time t(d) of discharge. Assuming that there is d certain specified separator thickness and that the electrolyte of the separator is the same as that permeating the positive electrode, it is possible to obtain the optimum porosity as a compromise between the desire to have active material present and the necessity to have a conduction path through the pores of the electrode. For a system with a foil negative electrode and an open-circuit potential which is independent of state of charge, this optimum value depends on one principal parameter T = U kappa(s)t(d)/q(+)L(s)(2), one which involves the time of discharge, the open-circuit potential U, the conductivity kappa(s), and thickness L(s) of the separator, and the capacity q(+) per unit volume of solids in the positive electrode. There is one other parameter: the ratio of the cutoff potential to the open-circuit potential. Other parameters are introduced to account for a more complex structure of the battery.},

Stability property of the estimation errors is analytically characterized by adopting a deterministic version of extended Kalman filter (EKF). This proposed algorithm is applied to estimator design for the state-of-charge (SOC) and state-of-health (SOH) in a lithium-ion battery using the developed reduced order battery models. Simulation results on a high fidelity lithium-ion battery model demonstrate that the observer is effective in estimating SOC and SOH despite a range of common errors due to model order reductions, linearisation, initialisation and noisy measurement.},

abstract = {The activity correction for the electrochemical reaction and diffusion of lithium in the intercalation electrodes where structurally phase transition occurs during discharge and charge processes was examined. The equilibrium potentials for the lithium intercalation electrodes were represented successfully by the Nernst equation with the activity correction, which was expressed by the activity coefficient models for non-ideal behavior in LiCoO2 and mesocarbon-microbeads (MCMB) electrodes. Particularly for the LiCoO2 electrode, the NRTL model with the heterogeneous treatment was found to be suitable to describe accurately the concentration dependence of equilibrium potentials and phase transition in the electrode. Thereby, we formulated the particle-scale model by using the activity correction with the heterogeneous treatment for the diffusion of lithium in the intercalated electrodes and the electrochemical reaction on the surface of electrode particles in order to reproduce the discharge/charge voltage profile. In the heterogeneous treatment, we considered that the effective diffusivity and electrochemical reaction rate in coexisting region of two different phases for LiCoO2 electrode were able to be calculated by a linear function of lithium concentration. It was observed that the activity correction and heterogeneous treatment improved the prediction accuracy for the particle-scale diffusion model coupled with the electrochemical reaction model.},

abstract = {Charging procedures at low temperatures severely shorten the cycle life of lithium ion batteries due to lithium deposition on the negative electrode. In this paper, cycle life tests are conducted to reveal the influence of the charging current rate and the cut-off voltage limit on the aging mechanisms of a large format LiFePO4 battery at a low temperature (-10 °C). The capacity degradation rates accelerate rapidly after the charging current reaches 0.25 C or the cut-off voltage reaches 3.55 V. Therefore the scheduled current and voltage during low-temperature charging should be reconsidered to avoid capacity degradation. Lithium deposition contributes to low-temperature aging mechanisms, as something needle-like which might be deposited lithium is observed on the surface of the negative electrode after disassembling the aged battery cell. To confirm our explanation, incremental capacity analysis (ICA) is performed to identify the characteristics of the lithium deposition induced battery aging mechanisms. Furthermore, the aging mechanism is quantified using a mechanistic model, whose parameters are estimated with the particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO). The loss of reversible lithium originating from secondary SEI formation and dead lithium is confirmed as the cause of the aging.},

abstract = {Lithium ion (Li-ion) batteries provide high energy and power density energy storage for diverse applications ranging from cell phones to hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs). For efficient and reliable systems integration, low order dynamic battery models are needed. This paper introduces a general method to generate numerically a fully observable/controllable state variable model from electrochemical kinetic, species and charge partial differential equations that govern the discharge/charge behavior of a Li-ion battery. Validated against a 313th order nonlinear CFD model of a 6Ah HEV cell, a 12th order state variable model predicts terminal voltage to within 1{\%} for pulse and constant current profiles at rates up to 50C. The state equation is constructed in modal form with constant negative real eigenvalues distributed in frequency space from 0 to 10Hz. Open circuit potential, electrode surface concentration/reaction distribution coupling and electrolyte concentration/ionic conductivity nonlinearities are explicitly approximated in the model output equation on a local, electrode-averaged and distributed basis, respectively. The balanced realization controllability/observability gramian indicates that the fast electrode surface concentration dynamics are more observable/controllable than the electrode bulk concentration dynamics (i.e. state of charge).},

@article{Namor2017,
abstract = {Physics-based models of electrochemical cells are of great interest for the future battery management systems (BMSs), due to their accuracy and capability to predict cell physical states. One of their main disadvantages, when compared to equivalent circuit models, is the fact that they rely on numerous parameters. The identification of these parameters is difficult and usually needs the tear-down of the cell and detailed electrochemical analyses. In this work, we address this issue by developing a novel non-invasive procedure for the parameter identification of a single-particle model (SPM) of a Li-ion cell. The main contributions are: (i) the reformulation of the SPM in order to achieve a minimum number of grouped parameters to be identified; (ii) the formulation of a series of experimental tests capable to identify individually and non-invasively given subsets of these parameters. Notably, we craft specific tests to identify separately the parameters related to equilibrium, intercalation and diffusive phenomena that occur within the cell; (iii) the validation of the reformulated SPM and the associated parameter identification procedure through comparison of simulation results with both synthetic and experimental data. The former are obtained from a detailed pseudo-2-dimensional (P2D) model of a MCMB-LiCoO2 cell. The latter are obtained through experimental tests performed on a Lithium-titanate cell. Both are cycled with current profiles representative of power-grid and electric-vehicles (EVs) operating conditions. For these profiles, the model identified versus synthetic data achieves a root-mean-square error lower than 0.3{\%} on the cell states and lower than 0.75{\%} on the cell voltage. The model identified versus experimental data achieves a root-mean-square error on cell voltage lower than 1{\%}.},

The results indicate that the electrode can tolerate moderately negative potentials because the lithium insertion process is facile relative to that of lithium deposition.

An improved pseudo two-dimension (P2D) model is established on basis of partial differential equations (PDEs), since the electrolyte potential is simplified from the nonlinear to linear expression while terminal voltage can be divided into the electrolyte potential, open circuit voltage (OCV), overpotential of electrodes, internal resistance drop, and so on. The model order reduction process is implemented by the simplification of the PDEs using the Laplace transform, inverse Laplace transform, Pade approximation, etc. A unified second order transfer function between cell voltage and current is obtained for the comparability with that of ECM. The final objective is to obtain the relationship between the ECM resistances/capacitances and electrochemical parameters such that in various conditions, ECM precision could be improved regarding integration of battery interior properties for further applications, e.g., SOC estimation. Finally simulation and experimental results prove the correctness and validity of the proposed methodology.},

abstract = {Advanced battery management systems (BMS) in electric vehicles (EVs) require immediate and accurate battery state, such as State-of-Charge (SoC) and State-of-Health (SoH) for efficient monitoring and control. To improve the state estimation performance of battery, an electrochemical model is applied in this paper. First, the electrochemical model is reduced to describe the instantaneous Li-ion concentration dynamics of each electrode sufficiently without main information loss. Second, two separate sliding mode observers (SMOs) combined with reduced order electrochemical model are designed to identify SoC/SoH of lithium-ion cell from external measured voltage and current value. An estimation scheme which is comprised of two subestimators is designed. They work jointly: one separate sliding mode observer (SMO) for SoC estimation using Li-ion solid-electrolyte concentration and the other observer for cell contact resistance adopting Lyapunov's stability theory. Finally, in order to demonstrate the performance of proposed scheme, the simulations are verified by experiments from a 2.3Ah high-power LiFePO4/graphite cell used in EVs. The results indicate that the proposed estimation scheme with the SMO algorithm performs well with initial error values. The maximum SoC and SoH estimation error are less than 3{\%} and 2.5{\%} under Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule (UDDS) drive cycles.},

abstract = {Battery capacity fade occurs when battery capacity, measured in Ampere-hours, degrades over the number of charge/discharge cycles. This is a comprehensive result of various factors, including irreversible electrochemical reactions that form a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) in the negative electrode and oxidative reactions of the positive electrode. The degradation mechanism is further complicated by operational and environmental factors such as discharge rate, usage and storage temperature, as well as cell-level and battery pack-level variations carried over from the manufacturing processes. This research investigates a novel Bayesian method to model battery capacity fade over repetitive cycles by considering both within-battery and between-battery variations. Physics-based covariates are integrated with functional forms for modeling the capacity fade. A systematic approach based on covariate identification, model selection, and a strategy for prognostics data selection is presented. The proposed Bayesian method is capable of quantifying the uncertainties in predicting battery capacity/power fade and end-of-life cycles to failure distribution under various operating conditions.},

abstract = {In a previous paper, we developed a method to produce a physics-based one-dimensional discrete-time state-space reduced-order model (ROM) of a lithium-ion cell. The method relies on linearizing the standard porous-electrode equations around a fixed state-of-charge (SOC) and operating temperature setpoint. The ROM is able to track a highly dynamic input accurately near the linearization setpoint, but its performance degrades as either the cell's SOC or temperature move away from this linearization point. This paper describes a way to extend the accuracy of the ROM over a wide range of SOCs and temperatures using a model-blending approach. Our results demonstrate that the approach accurately models the cell's voltage and internal electrochemical variables over a wide range of temperature and SOC, with little added computational complexity. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {A low-order battery model has been developed that incorporates stress-enhanced diffusion and electrolyte concentration distribution into a modified single particle model. This model addresses two important challenges of battery modeling for Battery Management Systems: accuracy and computational efficiency. The developed model improves accuracy by including the potential drop in the electrolyte based on the predicted li-ion concentration profile along the entire electrode thickness, and by including the enhanced diffusivity due to diffusion-induced stress. Incorporating analytical solutions into a conventional single particle model eliminates the need to sacrifice calculation efficiency. The voltage prediction by the proposed model is more accurate than the conventional single particle model. Compared to complex physics-based battery models, the proposed model significantly improves the computational efficiency of various discharge scenarios, including constant current, the Dynamic Stress Test, and the Highway Fuel Economy Test. Integrating mechanical responses into the single particle model not only increases model accuracy, but also makes it applicable to models for next-generation high energy density materials where mechanical volume changes are important.

Preparation of the battery cells prior to WVTR measurements includes opening of battery cells and extraction of electrode material, followed by resealing the encapsulations and adhesively mounting of gas couplings. A model describing the water diffusion through the thermal welds of the encapsulation are set up based on material analysis of the encapsulation material. Two WVTR equipments with different type of detectors are evaluated in this study. The results from the WVTR measurements show how important it is to perform this type of studies in dry environment and apply a rigorous precondition sequence before testing. Results from modelling confirm that the WVTR method has potential to be used for measurements of water diffusion into lithium-ion pouch cells. Consequently, WVTR measurements should be possible to use as a complement or alternative method to for example Karl Fisher titration.},

@phdthesis{Marcicki2012a,
abstract = {Lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries are a promising source of electrical energy storage due to their improved energy and power densities coupled with potential cost savings compared to previous battery chemistries. However, significant research is needed to achieve a level of technical maturity that enables greater market penetration in the electrified vehicle segment. Energy density is currently an opportunity for improvement, and this shortcoming is compounded by the unavoidable aging process that shortens battery life by reductions in the energy and power that a battery can deliver. Model-based analysis may be used to identify and suggest mitigation strategies for the performance limiting factors. Most battery models are macroscopic and ignore the presence of interfaces between the solid and liquid phases. In these regions, known as the electrical double layer, the ionic concentration and potential vary rapidly. A better understanding of the electrical double layer leads to improved models for interfacial charge transfer. The potential variation within the electrical double layer may also modify the rate of side reactions that occur in close proximity to the electrode surface, when compared with macroscopic models. Model order reduction techniques applied to the partial differential equations of porous electrode theory leads to models that can be used for parameter estimation and large-scale aging simulations, but retain important aspects of electrochemistry. Since the developed models of lithium ion transport and potential variation across the battery unit cell are of low computational order, parameter estimation techniques may be incorporated to gain insight into the set of parameters that represent aging. Application of nonlinear least squares estimation is particularly powerful because the models exhibit dependence on electrochemical parameters that have physical meaning. Two case studies are presented for the reduced order modeling techniques that incorporate chemistry-specific phenomena. Model-based diagnostics are useful to understand the aging process, since in situ methods for measuring the aging process are often not feasible due to the small spatial dimensions and long time scales involved. Diagnostic methods are applied to characterize the process of capacity loss for the two studied cell types. Once the performance limiting mechanisms are understood, predictive models can be developed. To address the instance where loss of cyclable lithium is deemed the dominant capacity fade mode, a capacity fade model is developed based on a novel interpretation of sold-electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer growth. This dissertation contains the development of reduced-order models suitable for aging parameter estimation, an identification of the dominant capacity fade mechanisms via a model-based analysis for two types of commercially available Li-ion cells, a micro-scale model of the electrical double layer near each electrode, and a novel model of SEI growth. In future work, the SEI growth model can be integrated with improved understanding of the electrical double layer to provide high fidelity capacity fade prediction.},

abstract = {This paper considers the state of charge (SoC) and parameter estimation of lithium-ion batteries. Different from various prior arts, where estimation is based on local linearization of a nonlinear battery model, nonlinear geometric observer approach is followed to design adaptive observers for the SoC and parameter estimation based on nonlinear battery models. A major advantage of the proposed approach is the possibility to establish the exponential stability of the resultant error dynamics of state and parameter estimation. The proposed adaptive observers are shown to be robust with respect to unmodeled process uncertainties. Analysis also shows the design tradeoff between the convergence rate and the robustness of the estimation error dynamics with respect to the measurement noise. Simulation and experimental results validate the effectiveness and main advantages of the proposed approach. Error analysis is presented and explains the experimental results.},

abstract = {Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) capable of drawing tractive energy from the electric grid represent an energy efficient alternative to conventional vehicles. After several thousand charge depleting cycles, PHEV traction batteries can be subject to energy and power degradation which has the potential to affect vehicle performance and efficiency. This study seeks to understand the effect of battery degradation and the need for battery replacement in PHEVs through the experimental measurement of lithium ion battery lifetime under PHEV-type driving and charging conditions. The dynamic characteristics of the battery performance over its lifetime are then input into a vehicle performance and fuel consumption simulation to understand these effects as a function of battery degradation state, and as a function of vehicle control strategy. The results of this study show that active management of PHEV battery degradation by the vehicle control system can improve PHEV performance and fuel consumption relative to a more passive baseline. Simulation of the performance of the PHEV throughout its battery lifetime shows that battery replacement will be neither economically incentivized nor necessary to maintain performance in PHEVs. These results have important implications for techno-economic evaluations of PHEVs which have treated battery replacement and its costs with inconsistency. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Tang2017,
abstract = {A thermal–electrochemical model of lithium-ion batteries is presented and a Luenberger observer is derived for State-of-Charge (SoC) estimation by recovering the lithium concentration in the electrodes. This first-principles based model is a coupled system of partial and ordinary differential equations, which is a reduced version of the Doyle–Fuller–Newman model. More precisely, the subsystem of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) is the Single Particle Model (SPM) while the Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) is a model for the average temperature in the battery. The observer is designed following the PDE backstepping method. Since some coefficients in the coupled ODE–PDE system are time-varying, this results in the time dependency of some coefficients in the kernel function system of the backstepping transformation and it is non-trivial to show well-posedness of the latter system. Adding thermal dynamics to the SPM serves a two-fold purpose: improving the accuracy of SoC estimation and keeping track of the average temperature which is a critical variable for safety management in lithium-ion batteries. Effectiveness of the estimation scheme is validated via numerical simulations.},

abstract = {A physics-based Li-ion battery (LIB) aging model accounting for both lithium plating and solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) growth is presented, and is applied to study the aging behavior of a cell undergoing prolonged cycling at moderate operating conditions. Cell aging is found to be linear in the early stage of cycling but highly nonlinear in the end with rapid capacity drop and resistance rise. The linear aging stage is found to be dominated by SEI growth, while the transition from linear to nonlinear aging is attributed to the sharp rise of lithium plating rate. Lithium plating starts to occur in a narrow portion of the anode near the separator after a certain number of cycles. The onset of lithium plating is attributed to the drop of anode porosity associated with SEI growth, which aggravates the local electrolyte potential gradient in the anode. The presence of lithium metal accelerates the porosity reduction, further promoting lithium plating. This positive feedback leads to exponential increase of lithium plating rate in the late stage of cycling, as well as local pore clogging near the anode/separator interface which in turn leads to a sharp resistance rise.},

abstract = {Silicon is considered one of the most promising anode materials for next-generation lithium-ion batteries. However, dramatic volume expansion during the lithiation of silicon complicates its practical implementation. Literature reports nanostructured electrodes, which are capable to accommodate the volume expansion, reducing associated swelling, degradation and capacity fading. However, several phenomena associated with the volume expansion, such as the reduction of the electrode's porosity, are inherent to the system and must be carefully considered for targeted engineering of high-energy lithium-ion batteries. Herein, we determine design criteria of silicon based electrodes, taking into account the volume expansion during lithiation. A “deformation threshold” is defined signifying the minimum value of the initial porosity that must be adjusted to avoid plastic deformation and dramatic reduction of the electrode's porosity during charging. In addition, a “C-rate threshold” is defined, guaranteeing diffusion limited currents not falling below a desired discharge rate. The impact of these theoretical limitations on the electrochemical performance of silicon-based electrodes is analyzed from an engineering point of view. The derived relations are used to optimize the electrode design parameters regarding maximum gravimetric and volumetric capacity.},

@phdthesis{Liu2017,
abstract = {This dissertation presents a framework for computationally-efficient, health-conscious online state estimation and control in lithium-ion batteries. The framework builds on three main tools, namely, (i) battery model reformulation and (ii) pseudo- spectral optimization for (iii) differential flatness. All of these tools already exist in the literature. However, their application to electrochemical battery estimation and control, both separately and in an integrated manner, represents a significant addition to the literature. The dissertation shows that these tools, together, provide significant improvements in computational efficiency for both online moving horizon battery state estimation and online health-conscious model predictive battery con- trol. These benefits are demonstrated both in simulation and using an experimental case study. Two key facts motivate this dissertation. First, lithium-ion batteries are widely used for different applications due to their low self-discharge rates, lack of memory effects, and high power/energy densities compared to traditional lead-acid and nickel- metal hydride batteries. Second, lithium-ion batteries are also vulnerable to aging and degradation mechanisms, such as lithium plating, some of which can lead to safety issues. Conventional battery management systems (BMS) typically use model- free control strategies and therefore do not explicitly optimize the performance, life span, and cost of lithium-ion battery packs. They typically avoid internal damage by constraining externally-measured variables, such as battery voltage, current, and temperature. When pushed to charge a battery quickly without inducing excessive damage, these systems often follow simple and potentially sub-optimal charge/discharge trajectories, e.g., the constant-current/constant-voltage (CCCV) charging strategy. While the CCCV charging strategy is simple to implement, it suffers from its poor ability to explicitly control the internal variables causing battery aging, such as side reaction overpotentials. Another disadvantage is the inability of this strategy to adapt to changes in battery dynamics caused by aging. Model-based control has the potential to alleviate many of the above limitations of classical battery management systems. A model-based control system can estimate the internal state of a lithium-ion battery and use the estimated state to adjust battery charging/discharging in a manner that avoids damaging side reactions. By doing so, model-based control can (i) prolong battery life, (ii) improve battery safety, (iii) increase battery energy storage capacity, (iv) decrease internal damage/degradation, and (v) adapt to changes in battery dynamics resulting from aging. These potential benefits are well-documented in the literature. However, one major challenge remains, namely, the computational complexity associated with online model-based battery state estimation and control. The goal of this dissertation is to address this challenge by making five contributions to the literature. Specifically: • Chapter 2 exploits the differential flatness of solid-phase lithium-ion battery diffusion dynamics, together with pseudo-spectral optimization and diffusion model reformulation, to decrease the computational load associated with health-conscious battery trajectory optimization significantly. This contribu- tion forms a foundation for much of the subsequent work in this dissertation, but is limited to isothernal single-particle battery models with significant time scale separation between anode- and cathode-side solid-phase diffusion dynamics.• Chapter 3 extends the results of Chapter 2 in two ways. First , it exploits the law of conservation of charge to enable flatness-based, health-conscious battery trajectory optimization for single particle battery models even in the absence of time scale separation between the negative and positive electrodes. Second, it performs this optimization for a combined thermo-electrochemical battery model, thereby relaxing the above assumption of isothermal battery behavior and highlighting the benefits of flatness-based optimization for a nonlinear battery model. • Chapter 4 presents a framework for flatness-based pseudo-spectral combined state and parameter estimation in lumped-parameter nonlinear systems. This framework enables computationally-efficient total least squares (TLS) estimation for lumped-parameter nonlinear systems. This is quite relevant to practical lithium-ion battery systems, where both battery input and output measurements can be quite noisy. • Chapter 5 utilizes the above flatness-based TLS estimation algorithm for moving horizon state estimation using a coupled thermo-electrochemical equivalent circuit model of lithium-ion battery dynamics. • Chapter 6 extends the battery estimation framework from Chapter 5 to enable moving horizon, flatness-based TLS state estimation in thermo-electrochemical single-particle lithium-ion battery models, and demonstrates this framework using laboratory experiments. The overall outcome of this dissertation is an integrated set of tools, all of them exploiting model reformulation, differential flatness, and pseudo-spectral methods, for computationally efficient online state estimation and health-conscious control in lithium-ion batteries.},

abstract = {The design of a lumped parameter battery model preserving physical meaning is especially desired by the automotive researchers and engineers due to the strong demand for battery system control, estimation, diagnosis and prognostics. In light of this, a novel simplified fractional order electrochemical model is developed for electric vehicle (EV) applications in this paper. In the model, a general fractional order transfer function is designed for the solid phase lithium ion diffusion approximation. The dynamic characteristics of the electrolyte concentration overpotential are approximated by a first-order resistance-capacitor transfer function in the electrolyte phase. The Ohmic resistances and electrochemical reaction kinetics resistance are simplified to a lumped Ohmic resistance parameter. Overall, the number of model parameters is reduced from 30 to 9, yet the accuracy of the model is still guaranteed. In order to address the dynamics of phase-change phenomenon in the active particle during charging and discharging, variable solid-state diffusivity is taken into consideration in the model. Also, the observability of the model is analyzed on two types of lithium ion batteries subsequently. Results show the fractional order model with variable solid-state diffusivity agrees very well with experimental data at various current input conditions and is suitable for electric vehicle applications.},

An approximate solution method for the diffusion of lithium ions within active material particles is formulated using the finite element method and implemented in the previously developed 1D electrochemical model as an explicit difference equation. Reaction current distribution and redistribution processes occurring during discharge and current interrupt, respectively, are driven by gradients in equilibrium potential that arise due to solid diffusion limitations.

abstract = {We present a new type of large-scale computational screening approach for identifying promising candidate materials for solid state electrolytes for lithium ion batteries that is capable of screening all known lithium containing solids. To be useful for batteries, high performance solid state electrolyte materials must satisfy many requirements at once, an optimization that is difficult to perform experimentally or with computationally expensive ab initio techniques. We first screen 12831 lithium containing crystalline solids for those with high structural and chemical stability, low electronic conductivity, and low cost. We then develop a data-driven ionic conductivity classification model using logistic regression for identifying which candidate structures are likely to exhibit fast lithium conduction based on experimental measurements reported in the literature. The screening reduces the list of candidate materials from 12831 down to 21 structures that show promise as electrolytes, few of which have been examined experimentally. We discover that none of our simple atomistic descriptor functions alone provide predictive power for ionic conductivity, but a multi-descriptor model can exhibit a useful degree of predictive power. We also find that screening for structural stability, chemical stability and low electronic conductivity eliminates 92.2{\%} of all Li-containing materials and screening for high ionic conductivity eliminates a further 93.3{\%} of the remainder. Our screening utilizes structures and electronic information contained in the Materials Project database.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT
The single-particle model is a useful mathematical representation for state-of-charge observation, parameter identification and control of lithium-ion batteries. This model is a simplified electrochemical formulation where ionic intercalation, described as a diffusive process, is considered as the dominant dynamics. In the search for a more efficient numerical solution of the involved partial differential equations, many approximations have been reported. However, most of them are valid just under restricted operating conditions. In this paper, spatial semidiscretization is reintroduced as the precision of approximations could be arbitrarily chosen with this approach. Three discretization methods are applied in a classical fashion, evaluated and compared in both time and frequency domains: finite difference, finite element and differential quadrature. In addition, two commonly used low order approximations are tested against semidiscretization approximations. The best results are obtained with the differential quadrature method in its polynomial version. Two model truncation criteria are also explored, one is based on bandwidth selection and the other on residue analysis, where the first resulted to be more conservative. Finally, simulations of representative reduced order approximations of the single-particle model are compared against experimental data found in the literature.},

abstract = {The importance of the concept of persistent excitation (PE) in adaptive identification and control has been recognized for some time. Recently it has become evident that it also plays a central role in many questions related to the robustness of adaptive systems. There is every reason to believe that arguments involving this concept will continue to feature prominently in the analysis of most of the important problems of adaptive control. Hence there is a real need for a deeper understanding of the concept. The paper is written with three objectives. The first, which is tutorial in nature, is to provide a general framework for the discussion of persistent excitation and to collect results in the area, which are scattered throughout the adaptive literature. The second objective is to present some new results related to the uniform asymptotic stability (u.a.s.) and robustness of adaptive systems and the relation of PE to the stability properties of a class of non-linear systems.

It is able to estimate the SoC when the model parameters are unknown, through joint SoC and parameter estimation. Design of the AdaptSoC builds up on (1) a reduced complexity battery model that is developed from the well-known single particle model (SPM) and, (2) joint local observability/identifiability analysis of the SoC and the unknown model parameters. Shown to be strongly observable, the SoC is estimated jointly with the parameters by the AdaptSoC using the iterated extended Kalman filter (IEKF).

abstract = {Electricity generated from renewable sources, which has shown remarkable growth worldwide, can rarely provide immediate response to demand as these sources do not deliver a regular supply easily adjustable to consumption needs. Thus, the growth of this decentralized production means greater network load stability problems and requires energy storage, generally using lead batteries, as a potential solution. However, lead batteries cannot withstand high cycling rates, nor can they store large amounts of energy in a small volume. That is why other types of storage technologies are being developed and implemented. This has led to the emergence of storage as a crucial element in the management of energy from renewable sources, allowing energy to be released into the grid during peak hours when it is more valuable. The work described in this paper highlights the need to store energy in order to strengthen power networks and maintain load levels. There are various types of storage methods, some of which are already in use, while others are still in development. We have taken a look at the main characteristics of the different electricity storage techniques and their field of application (permanent or portable, long- or short-term storage, maximum power required, etc.). These characteristics will serve to make comparisons in order to determine the most appropriate technique for each type of application.},

abstract = {Batteries are the key technology for enabling further mobile electrification and energy storage. Accurate prediction of the state of the battery is needed not only for safety reasons, but also for better utilization of the battery. In this work we present a state estimation strategy for a detailed electrochemical model of a lithium-ion battery. The benefit of using a detailed model is the additional information obtained about the battery, such as accurate estimates of the internal temperature, the state of charge within the individual electrodes, overpotential, concentration and current distribution across the electrodes, which can be utilized for safety and optimal operation. Based on physical insight, we propose an output error injection observer based on a reduced set of partial differential-algebraic equations. This reduced model has a less complex structure, while it still captures the main dynamics. The observer is extensively studied in simulations and validated in experiments for actual electric-vehicle drive cycles. Experimental results show the observer to be robust with respect to unmodeled dynamics as well as to noisy and biased voltage and current measurements. The available state estimates can be used for monitoring purposes or incorporated into a model based controller to improve the performance of the battery while guaranteeing safe operation.},

Depleted/saturated active material Li surface concentrations in the negative/positive electrodes consistently cause end of high-rate (∼25C) pulse discharge at the 2.7Vcell−1 minimum limit, indicating solid-state diffusion is the limiting mechanism. The 3.9Vcell−1 maximum limit, meant to protect the negative electrode from lithium deposition side reaction during charge, is overly conservative for high-rate (∼15C) pulse charges initiated from states-of-charge (SOCs) less than 100{\%}. Two-second maximum pulse charge rate from the 50{\%} SOC initial condition can be increased by as much as 50{\%} without risk of lithium deposition. Controlled to minimum/maximum voltage limits, the pack meets partnership for next generation vehicles (PNGV) power assist mode pulse power goals (at operating temperatures {\textgreater}16°C), but falls short of the available energy goal. In a vehicle simulation, the pack generates heat at a 320W rate on a US06 driving cycle at 25°C, with more heat generated at lower temperatures. Less aggressive FUDS and HWFET cycles generate 6–12 times less heat. Contact resistance ohmic heating dominates all other mechanisms, followed by electrolyte phase ohmic heating. Reaction and electronic phase ohmic heats are negligible. A convective heat transfer coefficient of h=10.1Wm−2K−1 maintains cell temperature at or below the 52°C PNGV operating limit under aggressive US06 driving.},

The proposed fractional model is based on simplifications of an electrochemical model and on resolution of some partial differential equations used in its description. Such an approach permits to get a simple model in which electrochemical variables and parameters still appear.},

abstract = {Battery management systems in hybrid electric vehicle battery packs must estimate values descriptive of the pack's present operating condition. These include: battery state of charge, power fade, capacity fade, and instantaneous available power. The estimation mechanism must adapt to changing cell characteristics as cells age and therefore provide accurate estimates over the lifetime of the pack. In a series of three papers, we propose a method, based on extended Kalman filtering (EKF), that is able to accomplish these goals on a lithium ion polymer battery pack. We expect that it will also work well on other battery chemistries. These papers cover the required mathematical background, cell modeling and system identification requirements, and the final solution, together with results. In order to use EKF to estimate the desired quantities, we first require a mathematical model that can accurately capture the dynamics of a cell. In this paper we “evolve” a suitable model from one that is very primitive to one that is more advanced and works well in practice. The final model includes terms that describe the dynamic contributions due to open-circuit voltage, ohmic loss, polarization time constants, electro-chemical hysteresis, and the effects of temperature. We also give a means, based on EKF, whereby the constant model parameters may be determined from cell test data. Results are presented that demonstrate it is possible to achieve root-mean-squared modeling error smaller than the level of quantization error expected in an implementation.},

abstract = {We present a method to produce a physics-based one-dimensional discrete-time state-space reduced-order model (ROM) of a lithium-ion cell. The resulting ROM can predict the five variables of a standard porous-electrode model—reaction flux, solid and electrolyte lithium concentration, and solid and electrolyte potentials—at any location across the cell cross section, as well as cell terminal voltage. The method to generate the model involves first linearizing the porous-electrode-model equations, and then deriving closed-form Laplace-domain transfer functions from the linearized equations. Next, the discrete-time realization algorithm (DRA) is used to convert the transfer functions into an optimal discrete-time state-space realization. Advantages of this approach include that the DRA avoids nonlinear optimization and gives a straightforward method for selecting the system order for the ROM. Simulation results demonstrate that the ROM cell voltage predictions and the ROM internal electrochemical variable predictions match very closely with results obtained by simulating the full nonlinear porous-electrode partial differential equations.},

Still, due to practical difficulties in implementing many of the methods in a fast and reliable manner, it remains an underused technology both in academia and in industry. To address this, we present a set of methods and tools with the aim of making techniques for dynamic optimization more accessible. In particular, we present CasADi, an open-source software framework for numerical optimization and algorithmic differentiation (AD) that offers a level of abstraction which is lower than algebraic modeling languages, but higher than conventional AD tools. We also discuss several of the many application problems which have already been addressed with CasADi by researchers from diverse fields.},

A sensitivity analysis of all its physical parameters is performed in order to find out their influence on the model output based on simulations under various conditions. The results gave hints on whether a parameter needs particular attention when measured or identified and on the conditions (e.g. temperature, discharge rate) under which it is the most sensitive. A specific simulation profile is designed for parameters involved in aging equations in order to determine their sensitivity. Finally, a step-wise method is followed to limit the influence of parameter values when identifying some of them, according to their relative sensitivity from the study. This sensitivity analysis and the subsequent step-wise identification method show very good results, such as a better fitting of the simulated cell voltage with experimental data.},

abstract = {One approach to creating physics-based reduced-order models (ROMs) of battery-cell dynamics requires first generating linearized Laplace-domain transfer functions of all cell internal electrochemical variables of interest. Then, the resulting infinite-dimensional transfer functions can be reduced by various means in order to find an approximate low-dimensional model. These methods include Pad{\'{e}} approximation or the Discrete-Time Realization algorithm. In a previous article, Lee and colleagues developed a transfer function of the electrolyte concentration for a porous-electrode pseudo-two-dimensional lithium-ion cell model. Their approach used separation of variables and Sturm–Liouville theory to compute an infinite-series solution to the transfer function, which they then truncated to a finite number of terms for reasons of practicality. Here, we instead use a variation-of-parameters approach to arrive at a different representation of the identical solution that does not require a series expansion. The primary benefits of the new approach are speed of computation of the transfer function and the removal of the requirement to approximate the transfer function by truncating the number of terms evaluated. Results show that the speedup of the new method can be more than 3800.},

The use of electrochemical models enables an accurate estimation of the SoC as well during high current events. However, this often due to the cost of a high computational complexity. In this paper, it is shown that by writing the model as a linearly spatially interconnected system and by exploiting the resulting semi-separable structure an efficient extended Kalman filter (EKF) can be implemented.

The model performance has been verified under pulse charge/discharge and dynamic stress test (DST) profiles with the standard derivation less than 0.021 V and the runtime 50 times faster. (2) the parametric relationship between the equivalent circuit model and simplified electrochemical model has been established, which will enhance the comprehension level of two models with more in-depth physical significance and provide new methods for electrochemical model parameter estimation. (3) four simplified electrochemical model parameters: equivalent resistance Req, effective diffusion coefficient in electrolyte phase Deeff, electrolyte phase volume fraction $\epsilon$ and open circuit voltage (OCV), have been identified by the recursive least square (RLS) algorithm with the modified DST profiles under 45, 25 and 0 °C. The simulation results indicate that the proposed model coupled with RLS algorithm can achieve high accuracy for electrochemical parameter identification in dynamic scenarios.},

abstract = {Battery design variable optimization can significantly affect battery capacity, discharge specific power, and discharge specific energy. However, many design variables need to be taken into consideration, which requires intensive computation and simulation. Our previously developed comprehensive battery degradation model is utilized in this optimization study via parallel computing. A three-electrode cell is developed for model validation over long term cycling. The objectives of optimization are maximizing discharge specific power and specific energy as well as minimizing capacity loss. Several design variables (e.g., thickness, particle size, and porosity) are optimized through a modified Elitist Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II). The obtained Pareto-optimal solutions that show electrode thickness, particle sizes, porosity, and conductivity are the battery design variables that can significantly affect battery performance. In addition, a sensitivity analysis suggests that a thicker electrode and a smaller particle size can improve battery performance. The optimized batteries have a better performance over 750 cycle's simulation: less SOC swing and less reduction of capacity. The design optimization framework developed herein can be modified and applied to various type of batteries with different optimization objectives and battery design variables.},

abstract = {State of charge (SoC) estimation is a fundamental challenge in designing battery management systems. An adaptive SoC estimator, named as the AdaptSoC, is developed in this paper. It is able to estimate the SoC when the model parameters are unknown, through joint SoC and parameter estimation. Design of the AdaptSoC builds up on (1) a reduced complexity battery model that is developed from the well-known single particle model (SPM) and, (2) joint local observability/identifiability analysis of the SoC and the unknown model parameters. Shown to be strongly observable, the SoC is estimated jointly with the parameters by the AdaptSoC using the iterated extended Kalman filter (IEKF). Simulation and experimental results exhibit the effectiveness of the AdaptSoC. {\textcopyright} 2013 AACC American Automatic Control Council.},

abstract = {Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV) current profiles are dynamic, consisting of repeated charge and discharge pulses. Accurate prediction of the battery response to these inputs requires models with open circuit voltage and Butler–Volmer kinetic nonlinearities. This paper derives a nonlinear, electrolyte-enhanced, single particle model (NESPM) that includes aging due to solid electrolyte interphase layer growth. The model is validated with experimental full charge, discharge, HEV cycle, and aging data from 4.5 Ah graphite/LiFePO4 cells. The NESPM is capable of operating up to 3C constant charge–discharge cycles and up to 25C and 10 s charge–discharge pulses within 35–65{\%} state of charge (SOC) with less than 2{\%} error. The NESPM aging model is then simplified to obtain explicit formulas for capacity fade and impedance rise that depend on the battery parameters and current input history. The formulas show that aging increases with SOC, operating temperature, time, and root mean square (RMS) current. The formula predicts that HEV current profiles with the (i) same average SOC, (ii) small SOC swing, (iii) same operating temperature, (iv) same cycle length, and (v) same RMS current, will have the same cell capacity fade.},

abstract = {Now the lithium ion batteries are widely used in electric vehicles (EV). The battery modeling and state estimation are of great importance. The rigorous physics-based electrochemical model is too complicated for on-line simulation in vehicle. In this work, the simplification of the physics-based model for application on real vehicle is proposed. An improved single particle (SP) model is introduced with high precision and the same level of computations as the original single particle model. A simplified pseudo-two-dimensional (SP2D) model is developed. The distribution of the pore wall flux is analyzed and an approximate method is developed to find the solution. The developed models are compared with rigorous electrochemical model and original SP models. The results demonstrate that the models introduced in this work could simulate the battery efficiently without too much loss of accuracy. A state of charge (SOC) estimation algorithm using the Luenberger observer with the SP2D model is proposed and shows high precision. This SOC estimation method could be used in the BMS in real vehicle.},

abstract = {The capacity of lithium ion batteries can be improved through the use of functionally graded electrodes. Here, we present a computational framework for optimizing the layout of electrodes using a multiscale lithium ion battery cell model. The model accounts for nonlinear transient transport processes and mechan- ical deformations at multiple scales. A key component of the optimization methodology is the formulation of the adjoint sensitivity equations of the multiscale battery model. The efficient solution of the adjoint equations relies on the decomposition of the multiscale problem into multiple, computationally small prob- lems associated with the individual realizations of the microscale model. This decomposition method is shown to significantly reduce the computational time needed for sensitivity analysis versus numerical finite differencing. The potential of the proposed optimization framework is illustrated with numerical problems involving both macroscale and microscale performance criteria and design variables. The usable capacity of a lithium ion battery cell is maximized while limiting the stress level in the electrode particles through manipulation of the local porosities and particle radii. The optimization results suggest that optimal func- tionally graded electrodes improve the performance of a battery cell over using uniform porosity and particle radius distributions. Copyright},

abstract = {Charging Li-ion cells at low temperatures and/or high currents can cause the lithium ions to deposit on the anode surface rather than intercalating into the graphite lattice. This effect, named lithium plating, may severely affect the performance, reliability and safety of the cell. Because metallic lithium at the anode consumes more space than intercalated into the graphite, the cell volume increases in the case of lithium plating. An experimental setup for precise measuring the thickness of pouch cells with a resolution of 1 ??m was built. The cell thickness as a function of its charge under standard cycling conditions was recorded as a reference. In the case of lithium plating an additional increase of the thickness was observed. This can be used as an indicator for the non-destructive detection of lithium plating in pouch cells. Compared with the standard capacity based methods this procedure allows a higher sensitivity and gives results more quickly. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Here we review this framework, in the context of applications to the coupled modeling of the thermal and electrochemical behavior of cells, and to the modeling at three different scales, namely pore-level, cell-level and stack-level. The similarity and differences of our approach with other research groups are exemplified. Significant results from each of these advanced applications of modeling are highlighted with emphasis on the insights that can be gained from a first-principles model. In addition, we also demonstrate the usefulness of a combined experimental-modeling approach in describing cells.

abstract = {Increased driving range and enhanced fast charging capabilities are two immediate goals of transport electrifi cation. However, these are of competing nature, leading to increased energy and power demand respectively from the on-board battery pack. By fi ne-tuning the number of layers versus active electrode material of a lithium ion pouch cell, tailored designs targeting either of these goals can be obtained. Achieving this trade-off through iterative empirical testing of layer choices is expensive and often produces sub-optimal designs. This paper presents a model-based methodology for determining the optimal number of layers, maximising usable energy whilst satisfying specifi c acceleration and fast charging targets. The proposed methodology accounts for the critical need to avoid lithium plating during fast charging and searches for the optimal layer confi guration considering a range of thermal conditions. A numerical implementation of a cell model using a hybrid fi nite volume-spectral scheme is presented, wherein the model equations are suitably reformulated to directly accept power inputs, facilitating rapid and accurate searching of the layer design space. We show how thermal management design can limit vehicle driving range at high charging temperatures. We highlight how electrode materials exhibiting increased solid phase diffusion rates are as equally important for extended range as developing new materials with higher inherent capacity. We illustrate for a plug-in hybrid vehicle, how the proposed methodology facilitates common module design of battery packs, thereby reducing the cost of derivative vehicle models. To facilitate model based layer optimisation, we provide the open-source toolbox, BOLD (Battery Optimal Layer Design).},

abstract = {At present, lithium-ion (Li-ion) cells are the core of electric vehicles (EVs). The complexity of electrochemical model makes on-line simulation difficult in electric vehicles. Thence, it is necessary to obtain a simplified model instantaneously under all operating conditions of the batteries. In this paper, simplification of electrochemical models of Li-ion battery to improve simulation and computational efficiency in EVs will be proposed. An isothermal pseudo-two-dimensional (P2D) model based on spatiotemporal dynamics of li-ion concentration, electrode potential in each phase, and the Butler-Volmer kinetics is developed. Since using traditional approaches to simulate the P2D model is computationally expensive, it has limited its use in EV's applications. Some methods can be used to decrease the number of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) that must be solved simultaneously and enable faster computation while using limited resources. Moreover, an averaged electrode (AE) model and single particle (SP) model which derive from P2D model embodies high precision and fast simulation of battery performance for a range of working conditions. Finally, the simulation results of the AE and SP model are compared with Doyle-Fuller Newman (DFN) model and show that the SP model can reduce computational amount significantly while still retaining the accuracy.},

abstract = {Lithium plating is a typical aging mechanism of lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries at low temperatures and high charge rates. Therefore an instant detection method is needed for safe battery operation and to increase the life time. Detection of lithium plating during operation is only possible by nondestructive analysis of short-term plating effects. In this study, we present a new approach to detect, characterize, and quantify lithium plating in a commercial graphite/LiFePO4 battery. This is crucial for battery management systems (BMS) in real-world applications. The method is based on a high voltage plateau in the discharge profile after charging at plating conditions. This voltage plateau corresponds to the stripping of plated lithium from the graphite surface. It is shown that differential analysis of such voltage profiles provides a quantitative estimation of lithium plating. The correlation between lithium plating and stripping necessitates a distinction of reversible and irreversible plating. Effects of various operating conditions, i.e. charge temperature, state-of-charge (SOC), and charge current, on the plating behavior are investigated in order to elucidate this degradation mode. Furthermore, the presented approach allows for determination of the reversibility of lithium plating. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Electrochemical models are arguably more accurate in capturing physical phenomena inside the cells compared to their data-driven or equivalent circuit based counterparts. Moreover, consideration of the coupling between electrochemical and thermal dynamics can be potentially beneficial for accurate estimation. In this paper, a nonlinear adaptive observer design is presented based on a coupled electrochemical-thermal model for a Li-ion cell. The proposed adaptive observer estimates distributed Li-ion concentrations, lumped temperature and some electrochemical parameters simultaneously. The observer design is split into two separate parts to simplify the design procedure and gain tuning. These separate parts are designed based on Lyapunov's stability analysis guaranteeing the convergence of the combined state-parameter estimates. Simulation studies are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the scheme.},

The interactions among these subsystems require a holistic understanding of the system architecture, control, power electronics, and their overall interaction with the electrical grid system. This review paper presents important aspects of a PV-grid integrated dc fast charger—with a special focus on the charging system components, architecture, operational modes, and control. These include the interaction between the PV power source, grid electricity, energy storage unit (ESU) and power electronics for the chargers. A considerable amount of discussion is also dedicated to battery management systems (BMS) and their mutual interactions in the control processes. For the power electronics, the paper evaluates soft switching non-isolated dc-to-dc power converter topologies that can be possibly used as future EV chargers. In addition to these, a brief discussion on the impact of the PV-grid charging on the ac grid and distribution system and their remedial measures are presented. Furthermore, the challenges in regard to the vehicle to grid (V2G) concept are also described. It is envisaged that the information provided in this paper would be useful as a one-stop document for engineers, researchers and others who require information related to the dc fast charging of EV that incorporates a renewable energy source.},

This paper presents a novel approach to the design and parametrization of a reduced-order model characterizing the dynamic voltage response of a Li-ion cell. The model is based on the assumption of uniform active material utilization and includes prediction of the ionic concentration and potential dynamics in the liquid phase, which significantly affects the voltage response for high currents. A model-order reduction procedure based on the Pade approximation method is used to reduce the partial differential equation model to a low-order system of ordinary differential equations. Systematic methods are proposed to identify the electrochemical parameters that govern power and capacity prediction, as well as their temperature dependence. The procedure is based on carefully designed experiments that isolate the influence of small groups of parameters on the voltage output, utilizing complete cell data for model identification almost entirely in place of half-cell characterization. Finally, an extensive validation with experimental data illustrates the ability of the model to accurately predict the cell voltage.},

abstract = {The detailed isothermal electrochemical model for a lithium ion cell comprises of 10 coupled partial differential equations (PDEs). It is computationally intensive to use this model for detailed parameter estimation, battery packs, battery management system algorithms, calendar or cycle life predictions etc. This work describes a reduced order model framework, which reduces the detailed model PDEs, to a manageable set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs), which can be used for the above applications. Volume averaging PDEs yield ODEs. Hence volume averaging is the basic method used for model reduction. The gradient or profile information lost on volume averaging is recovered through profile based approximations. For the lowest order reduced order model (ROM), a uniform reaction rate, quadratic electrolyte concentrations and quartic solid phase concentrations are assumed. In this ROM only 5 linear ODEs are solved, and the rest are nonlinear algebraic evaluations. When compared with the detailed electrochemical model of a lithium ion cell, this ROM gives negligible error at nominal currents and a maximum error of about 3{\%} at high currents, for a typical commercial cell.},

abstract = {Battery management systems in hybrid electric vehicle battery packs must estimate values descriptive of the pack's present operating condition. These include: battery state of charge, power fade, capacity fade, and instantaneous available power. The estimation mechanism must adapt to changing cell characteristics as cells age and therefore provide accurate estimates over the lifetime of the pack. In a series of three papers, we propose a method, based on extended Kalman filtering (EKF), that is able to accomplish these goals on a lithium ion polymer battery pack. We expect that it will also work well on other battery chemistries. These papers cover the required mathematical background, cell modeling and system identification requirements, and the final solution, together with results. In order to use EKF to estimate the desired quantities, we first require a mathematical model that can accurately capture the dynamics of a cell. In this paper we " evolve " a suitable model from one that is very primitive to one that is more advanced and works well in practice. The final model includes terms that describe the dynamic contributions due to open-circuit voltage, ohmic loss, polarization time constants, electro-chemical hysteresis, and the effects of temperature. We also give a means, based on EKF, whereby the constant model parameters may be determined from cell test data. Results are presented that demonstrate it is possible to achieve root-mean-squared modeling error smaller than the level of quantization error expected in an implementation.

There are many models available however these often require expensive-to-measure ex-situ parameters and/or contain unmeasurable parameters that were fitted/assumed. In this work, we have developed a new empirically parameterised physics-informed equivalent circuit model. Its modular construction and low-cost parametrisation requirements allow end users to parameterise cells quickly and easily. The model is accurate to 19.6 mV for dynamic loads without any global fitting/optimisation, only that of the individual elements. The consequences of various degradation mechanisms are simulated, and the impact of a degraded cell on pack performance is explored, validated by comparison with experiment. Results show that an aged cell in a parallel pack does not have a noticeable effect on the available capacity of other cells in the pack. The model shows that cells perform better when electrodes are more porous towards the separator and have a uniform particle size distribution, validated by comparison with published data.

abstract = {Lithium plating is a common problem for charging in high-rate and low-temperature Li-ion battery applications. The current "standard anode" material graphite is especially susceptible to the formation of lithium metal on its surface instead of intercalation. In order to improve the understanding of this phenomenon, this investigation was conducted using pulse-relaxation experiments, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and optical in-situ microscopy. For that purpose, current pulses up to 10 C were applied on graphite half-cells to induce plating on the anode's surface. The resulting characteristics (e.g., cell voltage and changes in surface morphology) were analyzed during pulses and subsequent relaxation. Several characteristic attributes could be detected whenever lithium plating occurred: i) a prominent kink of the voltage transient during charging, ii) a distinctive plateau in the subsequent relaxation of the cell voltage, iii) a gray deposit covering the anode surface which under high magnification shows iv) a net-like structure covering the carbon particles. These attributes may provide useful detection tools for Li plating. The observed characteristics for Li plating were explained regarding the involved microscopic processes. This model was used to understand dissolution of plated lithium on the particle surface after the charging pulse and could thus be confirmed by SEM investigations.},

abstract = {An accurate prediction of battery behaviors guarantees the reliability, security, and efficiency for current tasks. An electrochemical-thermal (ECT) coupling model for LiCoO2 battery is proposed to describe charge and discharge behaviors. With lumped thermal analysis, calculations of heat generation, conduction, and dissipation are added to a simplified electrochemical model. Battery mechanistic parameters are reasonably reduced and regrouped to reduce estimation complexity. Based on excitation response analysis, identification conditions are specially designed to obtain mechanistic parameters. Simulations are carried out to validate the applicability of model at different operating conditions. Simulation results of terminal voltage and surface temperature are in good agreement with actual experimental measurements at lower C rates and dynamic load currents. With proposed parameter estimation method, the simplified ECT coupling model can be applied to similar battery systems.},

abstract = {This book is a pedagogical presentation of the application of spectral and pseudospectral methods to kinetic theory and quantum mechanics. There are additional applications to astrophysics, engineering, biology and many other fields. The main objective of this book is to provide the basic concepts to enable the use of spectral and pseudospectral methods to solve problems in diverse fields of interest and to a wide audience. While spectral methods are generally based on Fourier Series or Chebychev polynomials, non-classical polynomials and associated quadratures are used for many of the applications presented in the book. Fourier series methods are summarized with a discussion of the resolution of the Gibbs phenomenon. Classical and non-classical quadratures are used for the evaluation of integrals in reaction dynamics including nuclear fusion, radial integrals in density functional theory, in elastic scattering theory and other applications. The subject matter includes the calculation of transport coefficients in gases and other gas dynamical problems based on spectral and pseudospectral solutions of the Boltzmann equation. Radiative transfer in astrophysics and atmospheric science, and applications to space physics are discussed. The relaxation of initial non-equilibrium distributions to equilibrium for several different systems is studied with the Boltzmann and Fokker-Planck equations. The eigenvalue spectra of the linear operators in the Boltzmann, Fokker-Planck and Schrödinger equations are studied with spectral and pseudospectral methods based on non-classical orthogonal polynomials. The numerical methods referred to as the Discrete Ordinate Method, Differential Quadrature, the Quadrature Discretization Method, the Discrete Variable Representation, the Lagrange Mesh Method, and others are discussed and compared. MATLAB codes are provided for most of the numerical results reported in the book.

abstract = {The performance of a lithium-ion battery is closely related to its manufacturing and can be impacted by variability in the electrodes. Typically, manufacturers must set aside cells which are deemed to be of insufficient quality, thus contributing to the cost of manufacturing high quality cells. The performance of a lithium-ion battery module, that is, a string of cells configured in series, depends on the performance of the weakest cell. In this work, the single particle model was adapted to simulate the coupled behaviour of an arbitrary number of cells configured in series. The impact of slight variations in the manufacturing of electrodes was then investigated with a goal of linking electrode properties such as variations in thickness, electrode density and active material weight fraction with the performance of battery modules made from these cells. Results indicate that the initial capacity, the rate of capacity fade and other important aspects such as the distribution of state-of-charge from one cell to another depends on the extent of variability in the manufacturing of the electrodes. In this work, the variation in the performance of the module has been quantified as a function of manufacturing variation at the electrode level.},

The Pareto fronts of two types of Li-ion battery are obtained using the modified multi-objective genetic algorithm NSGA-II and the final identification results are selected using the multiple criteria decision making method TOPSIS. The simulated data using the final identification results are in good agreement with experimental data under a range of operating conditions. The validation results demonstrate that the modified NSGA-II and TOPSIS algorithms can be used as robust and reliable tools for identifying parameters of multi-physics models for many types of Li-ion batteries.},

abstract = {Lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries are ubiquitous sources of energy for portable electronic devices. Compared to alternative battery technologies, Li-ion batteries provide one of the best energy-to-weight ratios, exhibit no memory effect, and have low self-discharge when not in use. These beneficial properties, as well as decreasing costs, have established Li-ion batteries as a leading candidate for the next generation of automotive and aerospace applications. In the automotive sector, increasing demand for hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), plug-in HEVs (PHEVs), and EVs has pushed manufacturers to the limits of contemporary automotive battery technology. This limitation is gradually forcing consideration of alternative battery technologies, such as Li-ion batteries, as a replacement for existing leadacid and nickel-metal-hydride batteries. Unfortunately, this replacement is a challenging task since automotive applications demand large amounts of energy and power and must operate safely, reliably, and durably at these scales. The article presents a detailed description and model of a Li-ion battery. It begins the section "Intercalation-Based Batteries" by providing an intuitive explanation of the fundamentals behind storing energy in a Li-ion battery. In the sections "Modeling Approach" and "Li-Ion Battery Model," it present equations that describe a Li-ion cell's dynamic behavior. This modeling is based on using electrochemical principles to develop a physics-based model in contrast to equivalent circuit models. A goal of this article is to present the electrochemical model from a controls perspective.},

It is able to estimate the SoC in real time when the model parameters are unknown, via joint state (SoC) and parameter estimation. The AdaptSoC algorithm is designed on the basis of three procedures. First, a reduced-complexity battery model in state-space form is developed from the well-known single particle model (SPM). Then a joint local observability/identifiability analysis of the SoC and the unknown model parameters is performed. Finally, the SoC is estimated simultaneously with the parameters using the iterated extended Kalman filter (IEKF). Simulation and experimental results exhibit the effectiveness of the AdaptSoC.},

abstract = {The design of a lumped parameter battery model preserving physical meaning is especially desired by the automotive researchers and engineers due to the strong demand for battery system control, estimation, diagnosis and prognostics. In light of this, a novel simplified fractional order electrochemical model is developed for electric vehicle (EV) applications in this paper. In the model, a general fractional order transfer function is designed for the solid phase lithium ion diffusion approximation. The dynamic characteristics of the electrolyte concentration overpotential are approximated by a first-order resistance-capacitor transfer function in the electrolyte phase. The Ohmic resistances and electrochemical reaction kinetics resistance are simplified to a lumped Ohmic resistance parameter. Overall, the number of model parameters is reduced from 30 to 9, yet the accuracy of the model is still guaranteed. In order to address the dynamics of phase-change phenomenon in the active particle during charging and discharging, variable solid-state diffusivity is taken into consideration in the model. Also, the observability of the model is analyzed on two types of lithium ion batteries subsequently. Results show the fractional order model with variable solid-state diffusivity agrees very well with experimental data at various current input conditions and is suitable for electric vehicle applications.},

abstract = {In this paper, a reduced-order electrochemical model of lithium-ion batteries is developed for control and estimation applications through analytical model order reduction based on a Galerkin projection method. The governing diffusion partial differential equations in the liquid and solid phases are approximated into low-order systems of ordinary differential equations while the physical meaning of all model parameters is preserved, allowing one to perform state and parameter estimation. The selection of basis functions for the Galerkin projection method and model order truncation is carefully determined based on analysis both in the frequency and time domains. With the reduced-order diffusion models in the liquid and solid phases, an extended single particle model incorporating the electrolyte dynamics is developed. The model is then validated against the experimental data gathered from two batteries with different chemistries (lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide/graphite and lithium iron phosphate oxide/graphite) at different input conditions. Results show that the reduced-order model agrees very well with experimental data at various conditions. Meanwhile, it can be simulated thousands of times faster than the real time, making it suitable for long-term-life simulation, control, and estimation applications.},

The optimized pack design satisfies the energy and power constraints exactly and shows 13.9-18{\%} improvement in battery pack properties over initial designs.

abstract = {Battery Management Systems - Design by Modelling describes the design of Battery Management Systems (BMS) with the aid of simulation methods. The basic tasks of BMS are to ensure optimum use of the energy stored in the battery (pack) that powers a portable device and to prevent damage inflicted on the battery (pack). This becomes increasingly important due to the larger power consumption associated with added features to portable devices on the one hand and the demand for longer run times on the other hand. In addition to explaining the general principles of BMS tasks such as charging algorithms and State-of-Charge (SoC) indication methods, the book also covers real-life examples of BMS functionality of practical portable devices such as shavers and cellular phones. Simulations offer the advantage over measurements that less time is needed to gain knowledge of a battery's behaviour in interaction with other parts in a portable device under a wide variety of conditions. This knowledge can be used to improve the design of a BMS, even before a prototype of the portable device has been built. The battery is the central part of a BMS and good simulation models that can be used to improve the BMS design were previously unavailable. Therefore, a large part of the book is devoted to the construction of simulation models for rechargeable batteries. With the aid of several illustrations it is shown that design improvements can indeed be realized with the presented battery models. Examples include an improved charging algorithm that was elaborated in simulations and verified in practice and a new SoC indication system that was developed showing promising results. The contents of Battery Management Systems - Design by Modelling is based on years of research performed at the Philips Research Laboratories. The combination of basic and detailed descriptions of battery behaviour both in chemical and electrical terms makes this book truly multidisciplinary. It can therefore be read both by people with an (electro)chemical and an electrical engineering background. List of abbreviations -- List of symbols-. Series preface -- Preface -- 1.

abstract = {Physics-based model has been regarded as a promising alternative to equivalent circuit model due to its ability to describe internal electrochemical states of battery. However, the rigorous physics-based model, namely pseudo-two-dimensional (P2D) model, is too complicated for online application in embedded battery management system. In this paper, to simplify the P2D model, a series of polynomial functions are employed to approximate the electrolyte phase concentration profile, solid phase concentration profile, and non-uniform reaction flux profile, respectively. Especially, the accuracy of 2nd-order and 3rd-order polynomial approximations for reaction flux is compared, and the higher-order is validated with more strength. Benefit from the acquisition of above variables, the electrolyte potential is derived directly according to the conservation of charge at electrolyte phase; the accuracy of activation overpotential is also improved by using the non-uniform reaction flux rather than assuming the uniform current density in single particle (SP) model. Finally, the developed model is simulated by different constant current rates, hybrid pulse and driving cycles, and its outputs are compared with P2D model and original SP model. The results demonstrate that the model proposed in this paper could capture the battery characteristics efficiently, and also significantly reduce the computation complexity.},

abstract = {A detailed three-dimensional thermal model has been developed to examine the thermal behaviour of a lithium-ion battery. This model precisely considers the layered-structure of the cell stacks, the case of a battery pack, and the gap between both elements to achieve a comprehensive analysis. Both location-dependent convection and radiation are adopted at boundaries to reflect different heat dissipation performances on all surfaces. Furthermore, a simplified thermal model is proposed according to the examination of various simplification strategies and validation from the detailed thermal model. Based on the examination, the calculation speed of the simplified model is comparable with that of a one-dimensional model with a maximum error less than 0.54K. These models successfully describe asymmetric temperature distribution inside a battery, and they predict an anomaly of temperature distribution on the surface if a metal case is used. Based on the simulation results from the detailed thermal model, radiation could contribute 43-63{\%} at most to the overall heat dissipation under natural convection. Forced convection is effective in depressing the maximum temperature, and the temperature uniformity does not necessarily decrease infinitely when the extent of forced convection is enhanced. The metal battery case serves as a heat spreader, and the contact layer provides extra thermal resistance and heat capacity for the system. These factors are important and should be considered seriously in the design of battery systems.},

The accuracy of model-based SOC estimation depends on the accuracy of the underlying model, including temperature effects that greatly influence cell dynamics. This paper uses a 7th order, linear, ESPM (electrolyte enhanced single particle model) as the basis for a Luenberger SOC observer for a lithium ion cell. Isothermal and non-isothermal simulations compare the SOC from a commercially-available finite volume code and the SOC estimate for a wide range of temperature (0 ≤ T ≤50 °C) and pulse C-rates (|I|≤15C). Arrhenius relationships between the ESPM model parameters and the sensed temperature improve SOC estimation. At low temperature (T{\textless} 10 °C) and low C-rates, temperature measurement reduces the RMS (root-mean square) SOC estimation error by up to ten times. At high temperature T≥ 40 °C and high C-rates (|I|≤15C), temperature measurement decreases SOC estimation error by more than three times.},

abstract = {The contribution introduces a new theory explaining the capacity increase that is often observed in early stages of life of lithium-ion batteries. This reversible and SOC-depending capacity rise is explained by the passive electrode effect in this work. The theory assumes a slow, compensating flow of active lithium between the passive and the active part of the anode, where the passive part represents the geometric excess anode with respect to the cathode. The theory is validated using a systematic test of 50 cylindrical 8 Ah LiFePO4|Graphite battery cells analyzed during cyclic and calendaric aging. The cyclic aging has been performed symmetrically at 40{\"{i}}¿½{\"{i}}¿½C cell temperature, varying current rates and DODs. The calendar aging is executed at three temperatures and up to four SOCs. The aging is dominated by capacity fade while the increase of internal resistance is hardly influenced. Surprisingly shallow cycling between 45 and 55{\%} SOC shows stronger aging than aging at higher DOD and tests at 4{\"{i}}¿½C exhibit less aging than aging at lower C-rates. Aging mechanisms at 60{\"{i}}¿½{\"{i}}¿½C seem to deviate from those at 40{\"{i}}¿½{\"{i}}¿½C or lower.

abstract = {Lithium-ion batteries are currently amongst the leading technologies for electrical energy storage. In automotive industry they are recognized as the most promising alternative to gasoline powered engines. State estimation of the state of the battery can provide useful information regarding the state of charge (SOC) and state of health (SOH) of the battery which play a crucial role in optimal and safe utilization of the battery. Although the electrochemical dynamics of the battery are described by nonlinear system of PDAEs, most works in the area of condition monitoring of the battery resort to empirical or equivalent electrical circuit models. These models don't provide any physical insight into the battery and lack insight into physical limitations of the battery. This work presents a particle filter algorithm for state estimation and condition monitoring of the Li-ion battery. This filter can effectively deal with the nonlinear and complex nature of the PDAEs describing the dynamics of the battery. It provides accurate estimation of the average as well as spatial distribution of concentration in the battery. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed estimation algorithm.},

abstract = {For control and estimation tasks in battery management systems, the benchmark Li-ion cell electrochemical pseudo- two-dimensional (P2D) model is often reduced to the Single Particle Model (SPM). The original SPM consists of two electrodes approximated as spherical particles with spatially distributed Li-ion concentration. However, the Li-ion concentration states in these two-electrode models are known to be weakly observable from the voltage output. This has led to the prevalent use of reduced models in literature that generally approximate Li-ion concentration states in one electrode as an algebraic function of that in the other electrode. In this paper, we remove such approximations and show that the addition of the thermal model to the electrochemical SPM essentially leads to observability of the Li-ion concentration states in both electrodes from voltage and temperature measurements. Then, we propose an estimation scheme based on this SPM coupled with lumped thermal dynamics that estimates the Li-ion concentrations in both electrodes. Moreover, these Li-ion concentration estimates also enable the estimation of the cell capacity. The estimation scheme consists of a sliding mode observer cascaded with an Unscented Kalman filter (UKF). Simulation studies are included to show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.},

abstract = {The physics-based single particle (SP) model was compared to the semi-empirical equivalent circuit analog (ECA) model to predict the cell voltage under constant current charge and discharge for different sets of Li-ion cell data. The parameters of the models were estimated for each set of data using nonlinear least squares regression. In order to enhance the probability of finding the global optima, a combination of the trust region method with a genetic algorithm was applied to minimize the objective function (the sum of squared residuals). Several statistical quantities such as sum of the squared errors, adjusted R2, root mean squared error, confidence intervals of the parameters, and prediction bounds were included to compare the models. A significance test (t test) on the parameters and the analysis of the variances (F and $\chi$2 tests) were also performed to discriminate between the goodness of the fit obtained from the two models. The statistical results indicate that the SP model superiorly predicts all sets of data compared to the ECA model, while the computation times of both models are on the same order of magnitude.},

@article{Perkins2012,
abstract = {Battery cell life depends critically on how the cell is used. Therefore, battery chargers and battery management systems must be designed to control cell usage carefully. In order to design optimal battery controls that effect a tradeoff between cell performance (in some sense) and cell life, a model of cell degradation is necessary. This model must be simple and incremental in order to be implemented by an inexpensive microcontroller. This paper takes a first step toward developing such a controls-oriented comprehensive cell degradation model by deriving a reduced-order model of a single mechanism: lithium deposition on overcharge, along with the resulting resistance rise and capacity loss. This reduced-order model approximates a physics-based PDE model from the literature, is simple and accurate, and may be used in optimal strategies for controlling lithium ion batteries. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The efficiency of the method results from block LU decompositions employed in the iterative schemes devised.

@article{Baba2014,
abstract = {To understand the thermal behavior of lithium-ion secondary batteries, distributed information related to local heat generation across the entire electrode plane, which is caused by the electrochemical reaction that results from lithium-ion intercalation or deintercalation, is required. To accomplish this, we first developed an enhanced single particle (ESP) model for lithium-ion batteries that provides a cost effective, timely, and accurate method for estimating the local heat generation rates without excessive computation costs. This model accounts for all the physical processes, including the solution phase limitation. Next, a two-way electrochemical-thermal coupled simulation method was established. In this method, the three dimensional (3D) thermal solver is coupled with the quasi-3D porous electrode solver that is applied to the unrolled plane of spirally wound electrodes, which allows both thermal and electrochemical behaviors to be reproduced simultaneously at every computational time-step. The quasi-3D porous electrode solver implements the ESP model. This two-way coupled simulation method was applied to a thermal behavior analysis of 18650-type lithium-ion cells where it was found that temperature estimates of the electrode interior and on the cell can wall obtained via the ESP model were in good agreement with actual experimental measurements.},

In this study, a novel adaptive, self-learning heuristic algorithm for on-board impedance parameters and voltage estimation of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) in electric vehicles is introduced. The presented approach is verified using LIBs with different composition of chemistries (NMC/C, NMC/LTO, LFP/C) at different aging states. An impedance-based reduced order ECM incorporating ohmic resistance and a combination of a constant phase element and a resistance (so-called ZARC-element) is employed. Existing algorithms in vehicles are much more limited in the complexity of the ECMs. The algorithm is validated using seven day real vehicle data with high temperature variation including very low temperatures (from −20 °C to +30 °C) at different Depth-of-Discharges (DoDs). Two possibilities to approximate both ZARC-elements with finite number of RC-elements on-board are shown and the results of the voltage estimation are compared. Moreover, the current dependence of the charge-transfer resistance is considered by employing Butler–Volmer equation. Achieved results indicate that both models yield almost the same grade of accuracy.},

However, large density-of-state due to flat bands leads to large transport effective mass, which results in a simultaneous decrease of mobility. In fact, the net effect of such a high effective mass is a lower thermoelectric figure of merit, zT, when the carriers are predominantly scattered by phonons according to the deformation potential theory of Bardeen–Shockley. We demonstrate that the beneficial effect of light effective mass contributes to high zT in n-type thermoelectric PbTe, where doping and temperature can be used to tune the effective mass. This clear demonstration of the deformation potential theory to thermoelectrics shows that the guiding principle for band structure engineering should be low effective mass along the transport direction.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose the design of a novel optimal strategy for charging the lithium-ion battery based on electrochemical battery model that is aimed at improved performance. A performance index that aims at minimizing the charging effort along with a minimum deviation from the rated maximum thresholds for cell temperature and charging current has been defined. The method proposed in this paper aims at achieving a faster charging rate while maintaining safe limits for various battery parameters. Safe operation of the battery is achieved by including the battery bulk temperature as a control component in the performance index which is of critical importance for electric vehicles. Another important aspect of the performance objective proposed here is the efficiency of the algorithm that would allow higher charging rates without compromising the internal electrochemical kinetics of the battery which would prevent abusive conditions, thereby improving the long term durability. A more realistic model, based on battery electro-chemistry has been used for the design of the optimal algorithm as opposed to the conventional equivalent circuit models. To solve the optimization problem, Pontryagins principle has been used which is very effective for constrained optimization problems with both state and input constraints. Simulation results show that the proposed optimal charging algorithm is capable of shortening the charging time of a lithium ion cell while maintaining the temperature constraint when compared with the standard constant current charging. The designed method also maintains the internal states within limits that can avoid abusive operating conditions.},

abstract = {We have previously described algorithms for a battery management system (BMS) that uses Kalman filtering (KF) techniques to estimate such quantities as: cell self-discharge rate, state-of-charge (SOC), nominal capacity, resistance, and others. Since the dynamics of electrochemical cells are not linear, we used a non-linear extension to the original KF called the extended Kalman filter (EKF). We were able to achieve very good estimates of SOC and other states and parameters using EKF. However, some applications e.g., that of the battery-management-system (BMS) of a hybrid-electric-vehicle (HEV) can require even more accurate estimates than these. To see how to improve on EKF, we must examine the mathematical foundation of that algorithm in more detail than we presented in the prior work to discover the assumptions that are made in its derivation. Since these suppositions are not met exactly in BMS application, we explore an alternative non-linear Kalman filtering techniques known as “sigma-point Kalman filtering” (SPKF), which has some theoretical advantages that manifest themselves in more accurate predictions. The computational complexity of SPKF is of the same order as EKF, so the gains are made at little or no additional cost. The SPKF method as applied to BMS algorithms is presented here in a series of two papers. This first paper is devoted primarily to deriving the EKF and SPKF algorithms using the framework of sequential probabilistic inference. This is done to show that the two algorithms, which at first may look quite different, are actually very similar in most respects; also, we discover why we might expect the SPKF to outperform EKF in non-linear estimation applications. Results are presented for a battery pack based on a third-generation prototype LiPB cell, and compared with prior results using EKF. As expected, SPKF outperforms EKF, both in its estimate of SOC and in its estimate of the error bounds thereof. The second paper presents some more advanced algorithms for simultaneous state and parameter estimation, and gives results for a fourth-generation prototype LiPB cell.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT
The single-particle model is a useful mathematical representation for state-of-charge observation, parameter identification and control of lithium-ion batteries. This model is a simplified electrochemical formulation where ionic intercalation, described as a diffusive process, is considered as the dominant dynamics. In the search for a more efficient numerical solution of the involved partial differential equations, many approximations have been reported. However, most of them are valid just under restricted operating conditions. In this paper, spatial semidiscretization is reintroduced as the precision of approximations could be arbitrarily chosen with this approach. Three discretization methods are applied in a classical fashion, evaluated and compared in both time and frequency domains: finite difference, finite element and differential quadrature. In addition, two commonly used low order approximations are tested against semidiscretization approximations. The best results are obtained with the differential quadrature method in its polynomial version. Two model truncation criteria are also explored, one is based on bandwidth selection and the other on residue analysis, where the first resulted to be more conservative. Finally, simulations of representative reduced order approximations of the single-particle model are compared against experimental data found in the literature.},

@article{Astaneh2018,
abstract = {In this paper we introduce a Simplified Single Particle Model (SSPM), which is obtained from the general mathematical formulation of Li-ion batteries. The model is validated by using different commercial graphite/LiFePO4 cells, and results show agreement with more complicated models and experimental data for low operating currents of less than 1C. A maximum relative error of less than 2{\%} can be observed to estimate cell voltage in the plateau region of the charge/discharge curves. Therefore, the proposed model is suitable in the case of stand-alone renewable energy systems, where battery current is typically lower than C/10. By increasing the current, the SSPM deviates from more accurate models and experimental data. However, it is sufficiently precise and computationally efficient to be used in the simulation and optimization framework of off-grid renewable energy systems. Finally, the proposed model will be applied to two different case studies; one for an installed PV-battery and the other for a Wind-battery system which are located near Zaragoza, Spain, in order to predict battery state over time.},

The rate of SEI film growth depends on both solvent diffusion through the SEI film and solvent-reduction kinetics at the carbon surface. The model is able to simulate a wide variety of battery aging profiles, e.g., open-circuit and constant-voltage storage, charge/discharge cycling, etc. An analysis of capacity-fade data from the literature reveals that the same set of aging parameters may be used for predicting cycling and constant-voltage storage. The use of this set of parameters for predicting storage under open-circuit voltage points out that part of the self-discharge is reversible.},

abstract = {In this paper, a gradient-free optimization technique, namely particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, is utilized to identify specific parameters of the electrochemical model of a Lithium-Ion battery with LiCoO2 cathode chemistry. Battery electrochemical model parameters are subject to change under severe or abusive operating conditions resulting in, for example, over-discharged battery, over-charged battery, etc. It is important for a battery management system to have these parameter changes fully captured in a bank of battery models that can be used to monitor battery conditions in real time. Here the PSO methodology has been successfully applied to identify four electrochemical model parameters that exhibit significant variations under severe operating conditions: solid phase diffusion coefficient at the positive electrode (cathode), solid phase diffusion coefficient at the negative electrode (anode), intercalation/de-intercalation reaction rate at the cathode, and intercalation/de-intercalation reaction rate at the anode. The identified model parameters were used to generate the respective battery models for both healthy and degraded batteries. These models were then validated by comparing the model output voltage with the experimental output voltage for the stated operating conditions. The identified Li-Ion battery electrochemical model parameters are within reasonable accuracy as evidenced by the experimental validation results.},

@article{DiDomenico2010,
abstract = {This paper presents a numerical calculation of the evolution of the spatially resolved solid concentration in the two electrodes of a lithium-ion cell. The microscopic solid concentration is driven by the macroscopic Butler–Volmer current density distribution, which is consequently driven by the applied current through the boundary conditions. The resulting, mostly causal, implementation of the algebraic differential equations that describe the battery electrochemical principles, even after assuming fixed electrolyte concentration, is of high order and complexity and is denoted as the full order model. The full order model is compared with the results in the works of Smith and Wang (2006, “Solid-State Diffusion Limitations on Pulse Operation of a Lithium-Ion Cell for Hybrid Electric Vehicles,” J. Power Sources, 161, pp. 628–639) and Wang (2007 “Control oriented 1D Electrochemical Model of Lithium Ion Battery,” Energy Convers. Manage., 48, pp. 2565–2578) and creates our baseline model, which will be further simplified for charge estimation. We then propose a low order extended Kalman filter for the estimation of the average-electrode charge similarly to the single-particle charge estimation in the work of White and Santhanagopalan (2006, “Online Estimation of the State of Charge of a Lithium Ion Cell,” J. Power Sources, 161, pp. 1346–1355) with the following two substantial enhancements. First, we estimate the average-electrode, or single-particle, solid-electrolyte surface concentration, called critical surface charge in addition to the more traditional bulk concentration called state of charge. Moreover, we avoid the weakly observable conditions associated with estimating both electrode concentrations by recognizing that the measured cell voltage depends on the difference, and not the absolute value, of the two electrode open circuit voltages. The estimation results of the reduced, single, averaged electrode model are compared with the full order model simulation.},

The various processes in a battery cell are simulated using a physics-based electrochemistry model. The design is automatically performed by coupling the battery model with a gradient-based optimization algorithm. We demonstrate the potential for gradient-based optimization by applying this framework to optimize the design of a lithium-ion cell with spinel manganese dioxide cathode and meso-carbon micro beads (MCMB) anode for a range of power requirements. Results indicate that variations in the electrode thickness and porosity at optimal cell designs can be quantified via active mass ratios and it is found that the active mass ratios for optimal cell designs are independent of discharge rate. },

abstract = {An approximate solution for the electrolyte concentration distribution is obtained for improving the computational efficiency of the physics-based lithium-ion cell models. The approximate solution is derived from the analysis of the essential physical processes, using a parabolic profile approximation which assumes that the electrolyte concentration profile in the porous electrode is a parabolic polynomial in x at any time. By comparing the electrolyte concentration distributions and its overpotential profiles from this solution with those from the numerical finite difference solution, it is validated that the solution from this study is better than most existed ones in light of real-time computations and controls in EV, HEV and so forth. Moreover, the approximate solution can be applied to any type of charge-discharge operating scenarios with no loss of accuracy. Particularly, this solution provides a simpler mathematical expression with fewer terms and higher computational efficiency. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Mu2017,
abstract = {Accurate state of charge estimation of lithium-ion battery is directly related to the safe operation of electric vehicles and also an indispensable function of the battery management system. Four aspects of efforts are made to improve the estimation accuracy. First, for overcoming the drawbacks of equivalent circuit model and electrochemical model, the fractional order impedance model is built via electrochemical impedance spectroscopy data and the fractional element is used to describe the polarization effect in a simple and meaningful way. Second, the discrete state-space equations of the impedance model are inferred by Gr{\"{u}}nwald-Letnikov definition and parameters of the model including the order of the fractional element are identified together by genetic algorithm (GA) and the experiment data of the dynamic driving cycles. Third, the fractional order unscented Kalman filter technique is presented and the ‘short memory' technique is employed to improve the computation efficiency of fractional operator. Lastly, experimental validation is implemented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach and results show that the SoC estimation accuracy can be improved by the proposed model and estimation method. The estimation error can be controlled within the range of 3{\%}.},

@book{Scales1985,
abstract = {In this textbook the author concentrates on presenting the main core of methods in non-linear optimization that have evolved over the past two decades. It is intended primarily for actual or potential practising optimizer who need to know how different methods work, how to select methods for the job in hand and how to use the chosen method. While the level of mathematical rigour is not very high, the book necessarily contains a considerable amount of mathematical argument and pre-supposes a knowledge such as would be attained by someone reaching the end of the second year of an undergraduate course in physical science, engineering or computational mathematics. The main emphasis is on linear algebra, and more advanced topics are discussed briefly where relevant in the text. The book will appeal to a range of students and research workers working on optimization problems in such fields as applied mathematics, computer science, engineering, business studies, economics and operations research.

@article{Sabatier2015,
abstract = {This paper deals with lithium-ion batteries modeling. From an electrochemical model available in the literature, several assumptions and simplifying hypotheses are proposed in order to get a simpler but accurate model. The obtained model is based on a fractional transfer function resulting in the resolution of a partial differential equation that describes the lithium ion diffusion inside the electrodes. The model involves only three parameters and a polynomial that fits the open circuit voltage of the battery. A method to estimate the model parameters and the polynomial is proposed. A single discharge test (constituted of several discharge steps) is required to operate the parameter estimation method. The accuracy for battery voltage prediction of the resulting model is evaluated with various tests.},

abstract = {This paper reviews the current status and implemen- tation of battery chargers, charging power levels, and infrastruc- ture for plug-in electric vehicles and hybrids. Charger systems are categorized into off-board and on-board types with unidirec- tional or bidirectional power flow. Unidirectional charging limits hardware requirements and simplifies interconnection issues.Bidi- rectional charging supports battery energy injection back to the grid. Typical on-board chargers restrict power because of weight, space, and cost constraints. They can be integrated with the elec- tric drive to avoid these problems. The availability of charging infrastructure reduces on-board energy storage requirements and costs. On-board charger systems can be conductive or inductive. An off-board charger can be designed for high charging rates and is less constrained by size and weight. Level 1 (convenience),Level 2 (primary), and Level 3 (fast) power levels are discussed. Future as- pects such as roadbed charging are presented. Various power level chargers and infrastructure configurations are presented, com- pared, and evaluated based on amount of power, charging time and location, cost, equipment, and other factors.},
