\capolettera{T}{aking} into consideration the  relative strengths and weaknesses
of  all the  physics-based reduced  order modelling  families in  the literature
considered  (see  \cref{ch:littreview}),  the   overarching  simplicity  of  the
\gls{spm}  coupled  with   its  immediate  potential  to  bring   the  power  of
physics-based predictions to  an embedded environment is a  strong motivation to
pursue  an in-depth  exploration of  its  horizons. This  chapter discusses  the
performance  of multiple  \gls{spm}  variants,  ranging from  the  basic to  the
sophisticated. The governing  equations of the conventional  \gls{spm} are first
introduced and its baseline performance is evaluated. Next, an in-depth analysis
of the basic  \gls{spm}'s drawbacks is performed. Various  published attempts to
mitigate  their current  challenges  towards implementability  is presented  and
their  inadequacies discussed.  Owing to  its simplicity  and latent  potential,
a  popular  modelling strategy  from  the  existing  art  that aims  to  enhance
the  performance of  the basic  \gls{spm} through  incorporation of  electrolyte
dynamics,  is  chosen for  further  analysis.  The  chapter concludes  with  the
author's critical  comments on  its relative  merits that  come to  view through
comparison against  a benchmark standard, whilst  simultaneously identifying its
critical  weakness  whose mitigation  forms  the  focal  point of  the  research
discussed in \cref{ch:newelectrolytemodel}.
