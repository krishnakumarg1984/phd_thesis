\section{Conclusions}

This chapter dealt with the in-depth analysis of ---
\begin{enumerate*}[label=\itshape\alph*\upshape)]
    \item the basic \gls{spm} and
    \item an electrolyte-enhanced \gls{spm} employing the quadratic spatial approximation model for ionic concentration.
\end{enumerate*}
Simulation results for  the basic \gls{spm}  reveal that   while its  \gls{soc}
computation is of acceptable accuracy even at moderate C-rates, it suffers from
poor performance in the prediction of terminal voltage at currents above  0.5C.
This renders the model unusable as the  plant model  for  state estimation tasks
since the  voltage measured from the  model  in a  feedback estimator shall  map
to a   distant \gls{soc} operating point.

% Although the  mitigation of mismatch  between the measured  quantity (terminal
% voltage) and  the estimated quantity (\gls{soc})  has not been studied  from a
% stability perspective, perhaps owing to its futility,

The  assumptions  and governing equations of the popular quadratic approximation
model for the spatial profile of  ionic concentration was presented. Simulation
results reveal that while its spatial  profile computation for a galvanostatic
operation is of  acceptable accuracy, the temporal  performance of the model  is
mediocre. In particular, the time evolution of ionic concentration at the
current collector interfaces computed by the model fail to capture the
intricacies in the temporal evolution exhibited by  the \gls{p2d} model's
profile.

This chapter concludes with a view that accuracy of the quadratic approximation
model needs to be improved upon before deployment in applications involving
highly dynamic load profiles such as a vehicular \gls{bms}. In
\cref{ch:newelectrolytemodel}, causal factors of the  lacklustre
performance of the quadratic approximation model is analysed in the context of
developing  at an improved representation of
electrolyte spatial dynamics through system identification.
