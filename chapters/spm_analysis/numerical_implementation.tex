The  equations  presented   in  \cref{sec:spmmodeldevelopment}  are  well-known,
self-sufficient and  fully descriptive so  as to implement the  basic \gls{spm}.
Although discrete-time numerical implementation  of circuit-oriented cell models
has been  considered~\cite{Plett2004,Plett2004a,Plett2004b,Plett2006}, there has
been  no such  treatment  of this  critical aspect  in  the \gls{spm}  modelling
literature. Since  this thesis has  a strong focus  towards enabling the  use of
physics-based models in an embedded  environment, at least the numerical aspects
of implementing  these equations  need to  be discussed.  The finer  details and
practical engineering considerations of real-time programming, in particular the
integration  of  the  cell  model  into  the  pack,  interaction  with  upstream
components and other such aspects  of a typical vehicular drivetrain controller,
are beyond  the scope of this  academic work. Nevertheless, the  discussion here
aims  to  lower  the  barrier  to  real-time  implementation  and  is  a  unique
contribution in the implementation context of cell models.

\subsection{Continuous-time Implementation}
\subsubsection*{Analytical solution}

Although  not   explicitly  given  in  \gls{spm}   literature,  using  \gls{lti}
system  theory,  the  analytical  solution for  continuous-time  state  equation
(\cref{eq:LTIstatespace}) with current input\footnote{The analytical closed form
solution cannot be obtained for constant  voltage operation. This is because the
boundary flux is implicitly determined  by the non-linear Butler-Volmer equation
\cref{eq:butlervolmer} and needs to be solved numerically with some variant of a
Newton-type iteration scheme.} is given by

The matrix exponential~$e^{At}$ is known as the state-transition matrix and is
defined as
\begin{equation}
    e^{A t} ≜ \mathcal{L}^{-1}\left\{(s I - A)^{-1}\right\}
\end{equation}
although several methods exist for its efficient numeric
computation~\cite{Moler2003}.

The analytical solution  given by \cref{eq:analyticalctssoln} can  be applied to
obtain the  matrix-vector state  equation \cref{eq:threestatesmatrixvec}  of the
\gls{spm}. Once  the state variables  are obtained  at a given  time-step, after
evaluating the  surface concentrations as per  \cref{eq:csurfposfromcavgpos} and
\cref{eq:csurfnegfromcavgneg}, they may be  substituted into the output equation
of \cref{eq:spmbasicoutputvoltagefinal}  to obtain  the cell's  terminal voltage
for that time-step.

\subsubsection*{Numerical considerations for continuous time implementation}

The  procedure  described  thus  far  has  a  practical  limitation.  The  input
current~$I(t)$ to the  cell has been defined as a  continuous quantity. Although
for the  purpose of characterising the  cell's behaviour, it is  possible to use
pre-determined continuous-functions  as load profiles  (\eg~sinusoidal waveforms
for virtual \gls{eis} testing), it is desirable to evaluate the model's response
to typical real-life conditions. In a vehicular application, only \emph{samples}
of cell current  measured by sensors at discrete-time intervals  are reported to
the \gls{bms}. A \gls{zoh} operation is  used at the model's input \ie~the level
of current is assumed to be held constant between two successive measurements.

% Current profiles can be computed from standard drive cycle data.

It    is    tedious    to    hand-compute   the    convolution    integral    of
\cref{eq:analyticalctssoln}.   However,  a   variety   of  state   of  the   art
adaptive-time  solvers  employing  numerical  schemes  such  as  Dormand-Prince,
Runge-Kutta,  Collocation and  Backward  Differentiation  Formula are  available
to  efficiently  handle  such  \glspl{ode}. Since  lithium  concentrations  vary
smoothly  over  time  without   abrupt  discontinuities,  a  standard  non-stiff
solver  of  moderate   order  shall  suffice.  A  single  line   of  code  using
\textsc{MATLAB}'s  ode45  solver  can  implement this  time  integration  \eg~\\
\mintinline{matlab}{[~,x_new] =  ode45(@(t,x) stateEqn(x,Ik,spm_params), t_span,
x_old); }

Since  the direction  of applied  current  is susceptible  to sudden  reversals,
(\eg~due  to  acceleration  and  braking events  in  a  vehicular  application),
the  solver   needs  to   be  stopped  and   re-started  every   sample  period.
\Cref{alg:ctstimespm} shows the sequence of  operations for a desktop simulation
of  the  continuous time  \gls{spm}  on  a  digital  computer. The  source  code
listing  of  an  example  implementation   in  \textsc{MATLAB}  is  provided  in
\cref{sc:ctstimespm}.

\input{chapters/spm_analysis/algo_ctstime_spm.tex}

In  the author's  view,  the  continuous time  \gls{spm}  algorithm has  limited
practical  use.  Computing  the  convolution  integral  or  deploying  \gls{ode}
solver codes  onto a microcontroller  is challenging and  introduces substantial
computational burden. Although the continuous time model can be used for desktop
simulation, more sophisticated \glspl{pbm} are  already available for this task.
Therefore,  for online  deployment  in  state estimation  and  control tasks,  a
discrete-time  version of  the model  suitable for  real-time implementation  is
needed.

% Nevertheless,  the  continuous time  \gls{spm}  has  one important  application,
% \viz~estimation of physical parameters.
% which will  explored  in \cref{sec:spmparameterestim}.

\subsection{Conceptual Overview of Real-Time Processing}

The   equations   in    \cref{subsec:basicspmgoverningeqns}   are   derived   in
continuous   time   form.  In   particular,   the   state  equation   given   by
\cref{eq:threestatesmatrixvec} describes  the continuous time  dynamic evolution
of  quantities such  as the  bulk concentration  and rate  of mean  radial flux.
However,  a  typical embedded  controller  such  as  that  used in  a  vehicular
\gls{bms}  operates   in  discrete-time~\cite{Andrea2010}.  This   implies  that
\emph{samples} of voltage, current and  temperature measurements are obtained at
a periodic time interval~$T_s$. The updating of solution variables are performed
between two successive data acquisition events from the sensors.

% The  computations of  the  model  equations and  updates  of solution  variables
% (such as  bulk concentrations  and terminal voltage)  are performed  between two
% successive data acquisition events from the sensors.


Execution of  control-oriented reduced-order  \glspl{pbm} such as  the \gls{spm}
and  their  associated  computations  are   modular  sub-tasks  of  a  vehicular
\gls{bms}.  A   single  \gls{bms}   often  provides  a   whole  host   of  other
auxiliary  functionality such  as  cell~balancing,  protection, diagnostics  and
data-logging~\cite{Plett2016}. Although  thermal management tasks  are typically
delegated to dedicated controllers, the \gls{bms} software routines often handle
data exchanged  between various subsystems  on the vehicular  communication bus.
While some of these tasks such  as book-keeping and diagnostics can be performed
at  a low  execution-rate, others  such as  cell measurements  and model-related
computations need to be performed with high priority.

\Cref{fig:basicRTCsoftwarearch} shows  an example of a  plausible implementation
of  a \gls{bms}  software  in an  embedded microcontroller.  The  vast array  of
functionality  performed by  the \gls{bms}  can be  grouped and  managed as  two
separate processes ---
\begin{enumerate*}[label=\roman*)]
    \item a background thread, and
    \item a foreground thread.
\end{enumerate*}
The  background  thread runs  continuously  within  the main  loop  sequentially
processing instructions. \Cref{subfig:bgRTprocess} shows an example illustration
of typical  background tasks that  a \gls{bms} handles. All  high-priority tasks
are  triggered  by  an  interrupt  and the  supervisory  control  loop  suspends
the  presently executing  background  task  for later  resumption.  As shown  in
\cref{subfig:fgRTprocess}, a typical example of such an interrupt driven process
is the  evaluation of the \gls{spm}  model equations and computation  of control
outputs and is discussed next.

\Cref{fig:timingdiagramBig}  depicts  an exploded  view  of  the timing  aspects
of  the  \textsc{Interrupt  Service  Routine}  that  was  briefly  presented  in
\cref{subfig:fgRTprocess}.  Upon  the  expiry  of an  on-chip  timer  calibrated
against a  baseline precision-clock,  hardware interrupts are  raised by  one or
more \glspl{adc} associated  with voltage/current sensors mounted  on cells. The
\gls{isr}  disables  the interrupt  and  reads  the  samples  of data  from  the
\glspl{adc} into software. At the end  of this process, the \gls{isr} rearms the
interrupts  and  simultaneously sends  and  acknowledgement  to the  appropriate
sensor which reloads its timer. The \gls{spm} model equations are then evaluated
in  software and  the  resulting  computational variables  such  as voltage  and
concentrations are  employed in  other pertinent tasks  such as  state estimator
subroutines. If  the \gls{bms}  also performs  control tasks  \eg~regulating the
coolant's  flow rate  or  \gls{ice}  state-toggling such  as  in the  hysteresis
control of a series hybrid drivetrain,  these control outputs are written to the
relevant \glspl{dac}.

\subsection{Sample Delay Considerations}

\Cref{fig:timingdiagramSmall}  shows a  vertically  compressed view  of all  CPU
activities across a larger  time horizon. The CPU's load factor  is the ratio of
time spent in foreground  requests to its idling time. While  a high load factor
is beneficial in terms of efficient usage of resources, it adversely affects the
power efficiency of the chip.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]

    controller]{A compressed timeline of CPU execution cycles showing details of
        activities within each sample interval. The execution sequence is shown
        over a larger horizon so as to illustrate the proportion of `activity
        time' relative to the `idle time'. The vast majority of the CPU cycle is
        spent in idling or background tasks. The servicing of the \gls{isr}
        occupies a relatively small fraction of each CPU cycle. Diagram

    \label{fig:timingdiagramSmall}
\end{figure}

For  Li-ion  cell  modelling,  a  sampling  interval  of~$T_s  =  1$\si{\second}
is   commonly  used,   thus  aiming   to   capture  the   cell  dynamics   below
\SI{500}{\milli\hertz}\footnote{In  the ideal  case,  according  to the  Nyquist
sampling theorem. In practice, the frequency range is smaller.}. The CPU's clock
used is of  several \si{\MHz}, a vast  majority of which is  spent in background
tasks or in sleep mode. Furthermore, a low-latency \gls{isr} code is employed in
the tasks  of reading the  \gls{adc} value,  evaluating the model  equations and
writing any control outputs to the  \gls{dac}. Using a simplified \gls{pbm} such
as the \gls{spm} helps in achieving a low-latency throughput for the \gls{isr}.

The overall implication of such a scheme  is that any \emph{delays} owing to the
sample and  hold process  at the model  input and outputs  can be  neglected. In
conventional sampled-data systems, control delays may be analysed by considering
a multiplicative factor of~$e^{-sλ}$ in the Laplace domain transfer function of
the system. Delay parameters of~${λ = 0.5  T_s}$ or ${λ = 1 T_s}$ are commonly
employed  as  conservative estimates.  However,  owing  to  the small  CPU  load
factors, in this thesis this delay term is omitted for discrete-time formulation
of the \gls{spm}.

\subsection{Discrete-Time \glsfmtshort{spm} Formulation}

% \Cref{fig:blockdiagctsdisc} shows  a block  diagram representation of  the plant
% model its associated input and output signals.

Due  to the  sampling and  \gls{zoh} operations  at the  \gls{adc} input  to the
system,  the input  to the  \gls{spm} is  transformed from  a simple  continuous
time  signal to  discrete-time sequences  \ie~${u(t) \mapsto  u[k]}$ and  ${y(t)
\mapsto y[k]}$,  where ${k =  0,1,\dots,∞}$~is the sample  index corresponding
to  the  continuous time  instant~${t_k  =  kT_s}$.  The continuous  time  plant
model  represented by  the  \gls{ode}  system of  \cref{eq:threestatesmatrixvec}
is  therefore   replaced  by   a  discrete-time  process   and  modelled   by  a
\emph{difference} equation which is to be determined.

% \begin{figure}[!htbp]

%     \label{fig:blockdiagctsdisc}
% \end{figure}

Consider       the       general      continuous-time       solution       given
by \cref{eq:genanalyticctssoln}. Let ${t_0 = k T_s}$ and ${t = (k+1)T_s}$, where~${k  = 0,1,\dots,∞}$. Therefore,
\begin{alignat}{2}
    x(t_0) & = x(kT_s)     & & \equiv x[k] \\
    x(t)   & = x((k+1)T_s) & & \equiv x[k+1]
\end{alignat}
Substituting these relationships into \cref{eq:genanalyticctssoln},
\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{x}[k+1] = e^{A T_s}\mathbf{x}[k] + \int_{k T_s}^{(k+1)T_s}e^{A ((k+1)T_s-τ)}B \mathbf{u}(τ)\,dτ \label{eq:intermediatediscrete}
\end{equation}
With  the  \gls{zoh} scheme  discussed  here,  $u(\tau)$~remains  constant  from~$k  T_s$  to~$(k+1)T_s$,  and  is  equal  to  $u(kT_s)$ \ie~$u[k]$.  Consider  a
change-of-variable definition  for the dummy  variable of integration  $\tau$ as~${\eta =  (k+1)T_s -  \tau}$. Thus,  $\tau = (k+1)T_s  - \eta$.  Hence, $d  \tau =
-d\eta$. Substituting these into \cref{eq:intermediatediscrete},
\begin{align}
    \mathbf{x}[k+1] &= e^{A T_s}\mathbf{x}[k] + \left[\int_{T_s}^{0}e^{A \eta }B \right] u[k]\,{-d\eta}\\
    \shortintertext{Reversing the order of integration leads to}
    \mathbf{x}[k+1] &= e^{A T_s}\mathbf{x}[k] + \left[\int_{0}^{T_s}e^{A \eta }B \,{d\eta} \right] u[k] \label{eq:disctimefulleqn}
\end{align}

\Cref{eq:disctimefulleqn} represents a discrete-time state-space representation
of the dynamics of the system whose generic representation is given by the
difference equation
\begin{equation}\label{eq:discgenericLTI}
    \mathbf{x}[k+1] = A_d x[k] + B_d u[k]
\end{equation}
where ${A_d = e^{A T_s}}$ and ${B_d = \int_{0}^{T_s}e^{A \eta}B
\,{d\eta}}$.
If the continuous-time system matrix~$A$ is invertible, a closed form
expression for~$B_d$ is obtained as
\begin{align}
    B_d &= A^{-1}(A_d - I_n)B && \text{(if $A^{-1}$ exists)}
\end{align}
For the continuous time system matrix~$A$ of the \gls{spm}, its determinant is
zero.
\begin{equation}
\begin{vsmallmatrix}
    -30\frac{D_\spos}{R_\ppos^2} & 0                            & 0 \\
    0                            & -30\frac{D_\sneg}{R_\pneg^2} & 0 \\
    0                            & 0                            & 0
\end{vsmallmatrix} = 0
\end{equation}
and hence  is not invertible.  This necessitates  an explicit evaluation  of the
integral in \cref{eq:disctimefulleqn} for computation of the discrete-time input
matrix~$B_d$.

Since  the only  non-zero entries  of  the matrix  lie along  its main  diagonal
\ie~its modes are decoupled, the matrix exponential reduces to a diagonal matrix
whose elements are simply the scalar exponentials of the original entries. The
discrete-time input matrix~$B_d$ can be obtained by evaluating \cref{eq:B_dinit}
as shown below.
\begin{gather}
    A_d = e^{A T_s} = \exp\left(
        \begin{bmatrix}

The  discrete-time  matrix-vector  system  presented  in  \cref{eq:A_dinit}  and
\cref{eq:B_d} have  not been presented in  existing literature, but is  vital to
understanding  the  implementation  of  the \gls{spm}  in  digital  controllers.
Although,  simpler alternatives  such  as Forward  Euler  methods are  available
to  approximate  the time-derivative  of  the  state  vector, they  suffer  from
problems  such  as  a  growth  in   the  rate  of  local  truncation  error  per
time-step~\cite{Ascher1997}, necessitating  the use  of very high  sample rates,
which increases  the burden on  the embedded controller. The  matrix exponential
approach is superior in  terms of accuracy and stability across  a wide range of
sample rates.

For  a  pre-determined  sample-rate,  the   matrix  exponential  and  hence  the
$A_d$  and   $B_d$  matrices  can   be  computed   offline  on  a   desktop  and
stored  into  the   non-volatile  memory  of  the  embedded   controller  to  be
loaded  onto  RAM  during  operation.   The  vectorised  implementation  of  the
state  dynamics  presented  here  is  highly  efficient  and  directly  amenable
for  use  in   classical  state-vector  algorithms.  For   the  cell's  terminal
voltage   computation,   the   basic   structure  and   form   of   the   output
equation  given  by  \cref{eq:spmoutputeqn}  remains  intact,  except  that  the
continuous  time   variables~$\left(\mathbf{x}(t),  u(t)\right)$  need   to  be
replaced  by  their discrete-time  counterparts  in  the corresponding  equation
set  \ie~\crefrange{eq:spmbasicoutputvoltagefinal}{eq:csurfnegfromcavgneg}.  The
discrete-time output function~$h_d$ is evaluated \emph{after} updating the state
vector (through \cref{eq:discgenericLTI}).
\begin{equation}\label{eq:discspmoutputeqn}
    y[k+1] = h_d(\mathbf{x}[k+1],u[k+1])
\end{equation}

The complete sequence of steps for implementing the discrete-time variant of the
\gls{spm} is given in \cref{alg:disctimespm}. In particular, it can be seen that
the  discrete-time system  and input  matrices,~$A_d$ and~$B_d$  can be  easily
pre-computed from  the parameter set  using the matrix exponential  approach. In
\textsc{MATLAB}, this  can be achieved  by passing  the arguments of  the matrix
exponential to the  `\verb+expm+' command. The vectorised  implementation of the
discrete-time  state equation  given in  line~\nolink{\ref{algLine:discstateEq}}
of  \cref{alg:disctimespm}  is a  set  of  efficient linear  algebra  operations
consisting of simple matrix-vector product and vector-addition routines.

This thesis strives  for an inclusive approach by taking  into account that some
battery researchers whose  focus is on fundamental aspects of  lithium ion cells
\eg~those  specialising in  electrochemistry,  might not  be  familiar with  the
nuances  of the  matrix exponential  and discrete-time  matrix computations  (in
line~\nolink{\ref{algLine:computeAdBd}}  of \cref{alg:disctimespm}).  Therefore,
a  snippet   of  \textsc{MATLAB}   code  clarifying   the  computation   of  the
discrete-time   system   and   input   matrices,~$A_d$   and~$B_d$   is   given
in   \cref{codesnippet:computeAdBd}.  A   full  code   listing  of   an  example
discrete-time  \gls{spm}  implementation  in   \textsc{MATLAB}  is  provided  in
\cref{sc:disctimespm}.

Thus,  a  discrete-time model  of  the  basic  \gls{spm}  is now  available  for
implementation  in  an embedded  \gls{bms}.  Further  analysis of  discrete-time
issues  such  as  aliasing,  quantisation  noise,  signal  pre-conditioning  and
discrete fourier analysis  lies in the specialised engineering  domain of signal
processing and falls outside  the scope of the thesis. The  results of the basic
\gls{spm} are presented next in \cref{sec:basicspmsimresults}.
