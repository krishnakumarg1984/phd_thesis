% the relevant subsection}

% Reducing  the number  of  computational  dimensions in  a  physical model  helps
% in  formulating  their  low  order  approximations,  thereby  facilitating  fast
% evaluations  of  the modelled  quantities.  The  \gls{spm}, originally  used  in
% modelling  the Metal-Hydride  chemistry~\cite{Haran1998}  and  later on  adapted
% for  Li-ion  cells~\cite{Ning2004},  represents  the canonical  apogee  of  such
% dimension-reduction strategies.


% A proposed enhancement to the basic \gls{spm} is the main contribution of this
% author and shall be discussed in \cref{ch:newelectrolytemodel}.
