Reducing  the number  of  computational  dimensions in  a  physical model  helps
in  formulating  their  low  order  approximations,  thereby  facilitating  fast
evaluations  of  the modelled  quantities.  The  \gls{spm}, originally  used  in
modelling  the Metal-Hydride  chemistry~\cite{Haran1998}  and  later on  adapted
for  Li-ion  cells~\cite{Ning2004},  represents  the canonical  apogee  of  such
dimension-reduction strategies.


During  the  initial years  following  its  inception,  the formulation  of  the
basic \gls{spm}  was discussed extensively within  application-specific contexts
such  as  \gls{soc}  evaluation~\cite{Santhanagopalan2006a,Santhanagopalan2008},
parameter    estimation~\cite{Santhanagopalan2007},   and    life   cycle/ageing
predictions~\cite{Santhanagopalan2008a,Safari2009}.   There   have   also   been
detailed   stand-alone   publications   discussing   various   facets   of   the
basic   \gls{spm},   such   as    its   inherent   assumptions   and   governing
equations~\cite{Santhanagopalan2006,Chaturvedi2010}. The basic \gls{spm} suffers
from  certain major  drawbacks which  are  discussed in  the simulation  results
presented  in \cref{subsec:simresultsbasicspm}.  Since the  turn of  the decade,
researchers  have attempted  to  tackle  many of  these  issues  and a  holistic
discussion of such efforts is presented in \cref{sec:electrolyteinclusion}.

A survey  of the  most recent  literature dealing with  the \gls{spm}  family of
models reveals a diminishing rate of advancement in quantifiable improvements to
the underlying plant model itself. This nearly-static trend can be attributed to
the general  consensus within the  research community  that these models  may be
too  simplistic  and  not  of  suitable accuracy  to  warrant  further  studies.
Other  than a  small  minority  of papers  that  either  propose core  modelling
improvements  to tackle  their inaccuracies,  or  add new  enhancements such  as
mechanical-stress  physics~\cite{Li2017a,Li2018b}, latest  work  in this  family
of  models predominantly  pertains  to  their application  in  areas like  state
estimation~\cite{Chaochun2018,Lin2017,Tran2017,Moura2017,Zou2016a},      optimal
charging~\cite{Perez2017,Perez2017a},    cycling    performance~\cite{Maia2017},
conversion           to            equivalent           circuits~\cite{Li2017b},
parametrisation~\cite{Li2018,Rajabloo2017,Bizeray2017,Namor2017}, pack-balancing
studies~\cite{Docimo2018a}  and   observer  design  for   joint  state-parameter
estimation~\cite{Ascencio2016}. The \gls{spm} approach  was also extended to the
case of  composite electrodes, leading to  a state estimator design  after basic
observablity  analysis~\cite{Bartlett2015}.  Owing  to  their  simplicity,  this
author believes that \glspl{spm} hold the highest potential to bring a \gls{pbm}
to embedded \glspl{bms}. With this goal  in view, this thesis seeks to resurrect
interest in this field by addressing the recent paucity in fundamental modelling
improvements. However, prior to doing  this, a complete analysis identifying the
strengths and  weaknesses of the salient  models within the \gls{spm}  family is
warranted.

% A proposed enhancement to the basic \gls{spm} is the main contribution of this
