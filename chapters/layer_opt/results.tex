At the outset, it is worth mentioning that the focus of this chapter
is on the layer optimisation \emph{methodology} itself. The results as
such do not stand alone outside of the modelling universe with all the
inherent assumptions discussed thus far. Presently, the value added by
this work is its ready adaptability to industry through its modular
design. A numerical implementation in the form of a toolbox\footnote{The
\gls{bold} Toolbox is made available for download from GitHub. \\
\mbox{\href{https://github.com/ImperialCollegeESE/BOLD_Toolbox}{\includegraphics
[width=0.025\textwidth]{github.pdf}}} \url{
https://github.com/ImperialCollegeESE/BOLD_Toolbox}} is also provided which
is immediately available for download and use by industry. This author
recommends that until the tool matures, cell manufacturers substitute their own
parameters and adjust other numerical coefficients suitably so that the toolbox
supplements, rather than supplants their empirical layer designs. Hence, the
results presented in this section must be interpreted in the backdrop of the
context within which the methodology was developed implying that the reader
must consciously strive to interpret all numerical values in relative terms of
magnitude. To aid this thought process, this author chooses to deliberately
limit the discussion on the absolute magnitude of numbers presented here.

%\subsection{Modelling Platform and Preconditioning}

%Couple of statements  about why LIONSIMBA was chosen as  the modelling platform
%for implementing the p2d dynamics. The  cell parameters used are shown in table
%xx. This cell is henceforth known as the LIONSIMBA cell or Northrop cell.

%Discuss the  missing elements  in LIONSIMBA  only with  respect to  the present
%problem at hand, \viz{the stoichiometries}.

%%\subsubsection*{Stoichiometry Augmentation}

%%Discuss the problem first. How LIONSIMBA started always at 85.51 percentage and
%%needed to  do a  discharge down to  zero percent before  having the  ability to
%%charge. For this project, stoichiometries  are vital for capacity determination
%%and  the 1C  current density.  Explain how  stoichiometries were  refined until
%%cut-off for  infinitesimal bleeding discharge current  achieved. Noted relevant
%%values. Explain refinement  of how approximate capacities  reported by Northrop
%%and Subramanian were  refined precisely. Explanation of  remnant capacities and
%%stoichiometries computation. Explanation of  1C current density.parameters init
%%capacity computation code.
