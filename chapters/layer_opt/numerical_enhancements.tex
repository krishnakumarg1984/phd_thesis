\subsection{Augmentations to parameter set}\label{sec:p2daugmentations}

\subsubsection*{Cell capacity and electrochemically active surface area}

The  \glsfirst{p2d} implementation  of  the standard  \glsfirst{dfn}  model
lacks  certain parameters that are vital to the  layer optimisation process. The
cell's nominal capacity is a fundamental quantity that gets  altered as the
number of layers is varied. However, it may be surprising  to discover that this
parameter is absent in the  research literature  discussing the  \gls{p2d}
model.  The rationale behind this glaring omission becomes clear  upon closer
examination of the model equations presented in  \cref{tbl:dfneqns}. These
equations do not  operate on a cell level, but  instead are formulated on a
normalised  basis. To clarify, only one layer of the  cell is being modelled
wherein the  stimulus driving the model is  the applied  current  \emph{density
per  unit area}  rather  than the  total external current. The model to be  used
in the layer optimisation task therefore faces  a unique  predicament ---  the
need  to adhere  to the  present modelling paradigm for compatibility  with the
\mbox{status quo} whilst being  flexible enough to incorporate the cell's
capacity as a function of number of layers.

To  tackle  the  aforementioned  quandary,  it   is  key  to  realise  that  the
core  parameter  that  varies  with  the  number  of  layers  in  a  pouch  cell
is  the electrochemically  active cross-sectional  surface area~$A_\text{cell}$.
Curiously, published  literature on  physics-based cell  modelling do  not place
rigorous  emphasis on  this key  parameter. More  often, much  to this  author's
chagrin, this parameter  is simply listed in a standard  table of parameters and
is typically sourced from a historic parameter-set without further explanation.

For  a pouch  cell, the  overall electrochemically  active surface  area can  be
defined as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:overallarea}
    A_\text{cell} = n \times A_\text{elec}
\end{equation}
where $n$~is the number of layers and $A_\text{elec}$~is the active surface area
per layer.

\subsubsection*{Surface area per layer}\label{sec:surfareaperlayer}

A  literature search  reveals that  akin  to the  cell's capacity,  there is  no
information of cross-sectional  geometry in articles dealing  with the \gls{p2d}
implementation of the \gls{dfn} model. To  determine the surface area per layer,
relying on  certain assumptions and  the recent literature, a novel  methodology
is proposed involving  a sequence  of steps.  The process  involves the
selection  of a real-world  cell, and  determining  its  surface area  per 
layer.  To the  best knowledge of the author, this  reverse parametrisation
process (explained next), mapping from a real-world cell to a new \gls{p2d}
parameter, is a unique idea.

    \item \hypertarget{refcellselection}{\textbf{Selection of a suitable reference capacity cell}}

        % Although this value  shall not be used in the  actual layer optimisation procedure  itself,
        This is a crucial first-step  towards obtaining a complete parameter set
        --- particularly to determine the surface area per layer.

        The  focus of  this chapter  is to  provide a  ready-to-use solution  to
        industry  that  improves  upon  the present  empirical  designs  through
        optimal  layer   configuration  of  pouch   cells.  There  is   a  clear
        motivation  to  further  increase  cell capacities  so  as  to  maximise
        the  \glsfirst{aer}, as  laid  out  in the  beginning  of  this chapter  (see
        \cref{sec:layeroptintro}).

        With  this guiding  principle, as  a starting  point towards  choosing a
        reference  capacity  cell,  a  survey  was  performed  to  identify  the
        production \gls{bev}  with the  highest driving  range. As  of 2018,~the
        Chevrolet  Bolt~\gls{bev}  bears  this   distinction  with  a  range  of
        \SI{383}{\kilo\meter}  as  rated  by  the  United  States  Environmental
        Protection  Agency (EPA).  The  specifications of  its  battery pack  is
        listed in Liu~\etal~\cite{Liu2016a}. The  battery pack of this \gls{bev}
        consists of 288~cells  arranged in a 96S-3P  configuration, in agreement
        with  the  configuration  discussed   in  the  drivetrain  hierarchy  of
        \cref{sec:packlevelhierarchy}.

        The    Chevrolet   Bolt    \gls{bev}   pack    has   an    energy   capacity
        of   \SI{60.0}{\kilo\watthour}    with   a    nominal   pack    voltage   of~\SI{350}{\volt}~\cite{Liu2016a}.  However,  for   this  specific  task,  the
        \si{\amphour} capacity is required. This can be obtained as
        \begin{align}
            \text{\si{\amphour} capacity of reference cell} & = \frac{\text{Pack Energy } (\si{\watthour})}{\text{Nominal pack voltage (V)} \times {\text{No. of cells in parallel}}} \\
            {}                                              & = \frac{60000}{350 \times 3}                                                                                            \\
            {}                                              & = \SI{57.14}{\amphour}
        \end{align}

        \begin{itemize}[ leftmargin=10pt, itemindent=15pt, labelwidth=5pt, labelsep=5pt, listparindent=0.7cm, align=left]
            \item \textbf{DC bus voltage and revised cell capacity}

                Even  without  a  dc/dc  boost   converter,  robust  design  of  the
                powertrain during  brown-outs should  allow for  continued operation
                even   with   a  slightly   diminished   DC   bus  voltage   \approx
                \SIrange{4}{5}{\percent} lower than nominal~\cite{Maksimovic2012}.
                Considering a maximum permissible dip of \SI{4}{\percent} in the bus
                voltage \ie~\SI{336}{\volt}, the cell's capacity may be refined as
                \begin{align}
                    \text{\si{\amphour} capacity of reference cell} & = \frac{\text{Pack Energy } (\si{\watthour})}{\text{Lowest pack voltage (V)} \times {\text{No. of cells in parallel}}} \\
                    {}                                              & = \frac{60000}{336 \times 3}                                                                                           \\
                    {}                                              & = \SI{59.52}{\amphour}
                \end{align}
                The  reference   cell's  \si{\amphour}  capacity   is  therefore
                rounded  to \textbf{\SI{60}{\amphour}}\footnote{In  the interest
                of   maintaining   consistency,   this  computed   capacity   is
                retained  for  the  cell used  in  chapters~\ref{ch:spmanalysis}
                and~\ref{ch:newelectrolytemodel}    of    this   thesis.    This
                also   explains   the   use    of   \SI{60}{\ampere}   for   the
                simulations  used for  demonstrating  energy/power trade-off  of
                \cref{sec:energypowertradeoffdemo}  since   this  current  level
                corresponds to the 1C-rate of this reference cell.}. The 1C-rate
                of this reference cell is therefore \SI{60}{\ampere}.

            \item \hypertarget{celllowercutoff}{\textbf{Lower cutoff voltage for cells}}

                In  this  layer  optimisation work,  following  the  assumptions
                of    \cref{subsec:layeroptassumptions},   the    overall   pack
                configuration remains  unchanged \ie~independent of  number of
                layers  within the  pouch.  This implies  that the  undervoltage
                threshold  for  DC  bus   voltage  throughout  this  work  shall
                remain  fixed  at~\SI{336}{\volt}.  Therefore,  with  96~series
                connected cells  in a string,  the lower cut-off voltage  for an
                individual  cell  is~\textbf{\SI{3.5}{\volt}}.  This  value  is
                reported  in \cref{tbl:lcoSimParamslayeropt}  and is  used as  a
                termination  condition  for  all  simulations  as  explained  in
                \cref{sec:layeroptframework}.

        \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Computation of electrochemically overall active surface area for reference cell}

        For   the  cell   properties  in   tables~\ref{tbl:lcoSimParamslayeropt}
        and~\ref{tbl:lcoSimParamsSPMp2d},    the    majority    of    parameters
        are      sourced      from      Subramanian~\etal~\cite{Subramanian2009}
        and                Northrop~\etal~\cite{Northrop2011}.                In
        Northrop~\etal~\cite{Northrop2011},  the   \emph{current  density}  that
        corresponds to a 1C-rate discharge of  a cell with this parameter set is
        reported to be~\approx\SI{30}{\ampere\per\meter\squared}. With the help
        of carefully designed numerical simulations  (very slow discharge with a
        trickle current from  fully charged state until  charge depletion), this
        value is refined to~\SI{29.23}{\ampere\per\meter\squared}.

        The  task of  determining the  electrochemically active  overall surface
        area of the reference cell is now straightforward, and is obtained as
        \begin{align}
            \text{Overall surface area of reference cell}, A_\text{refcell} &=
            \frac{\text{1C-rate for the reference cell (\si{\ampere})}}{\text{1C-rate density (\si{\ampere\per\meter\squared})}} \\
                                                                            &= \frac{60}{29.23} \\
                                                                            &= \SI{2.053}{\meter\squared}
        \end{align}
        This  value  is  listed  in  \cref{tbl:lcoSimParamsSPMp2d}  for  use  in
        \crefrange{ch:spmanalysis}{ch:newelectrolytemodel},  but  is  \emph{not}
        used directly in  this layer optimisation work. This is  because, as the
        number  of  layers change,  the  overall  surface  area changes  as  per
        \cref{eq:overallarea}. However,  determining this value is  an important
        initial step in the determination of the surface area per layer.

    \item \textbf{Setting the pouch height for the reference cell}

        Although  the   official  press   release~\cite{GMBoltBatteryDims}  from
        the  manufacturer  of  the  Bolt  \gls{bev} does  contain  data  on  the
        cross-sectional  geometry of  the cell,  it does  not report  the cell's
        height. Hence,  this information  needs to  be assumed  by extrapolation
        from an alternate source wherein the  conditions are similar and so that
        value may be applied for the reference cell.

        The   review  article   by  Gr\"oger~\etal~\cite{Groger2015}   discusses
        the   state   of   the   art    in   energy   densities   of   electrode
        materials    used   in    various    lithium    ion   chemistries.    At
        the    time    of   its    publication,    the    areal   capacity    of
        cells  were~\approx\SI{2.0}{\milli\amphour\per\centi\meter\squared}.
        Gr\"oger and colleagues   recommended    an    areal    capacity  
        target    of \SI{4.0}{\milli\amphour\per\centi\meter\squared}  for
        future  automotive applications. The said publication also considers the
        aspect of stacking layers  into  pouches  of   certain  geometries.  In 
        particular,  table \romanletter{4}  of Gr\"oger~\etal~\cite{Groger2015} 
        considers a  pouch of  \SI{10}{\milli\meter} height,  for  which  the
        aforementioned  areal capacities were calculated.

        In       the        case       of       the        reference       cell
        under       consideration,       the      areal       capacity       is
        \begin{equation}
            \text{Areal capacity of reference cell } = \frac{\SI{60000}{\milli\amphour}}{\SI{20527}{\centi\meter\squared}}  = \SI{2.92}{\milli\amphour\per\centi\meter\squared}
        \end{equation}
        which is  close to the desired  value in automotive applications  as per
        the recommendations  in Gr\"oger~\etal.  Considering that  the reference
        cell is based on the high  energy density Chevrolet Bolt \gls{bev} cell,
        a pouch height of \SI{10}{\milli\meter} is justifiable for this task and
        is reported  in \cref{tbl:lcoSimParamslayeropt}. This numerical value is
        comparable to that of commercially available cells for automotive
        applications. For instance, a \SI{56.3}{\amphour} cell with a pouch
        height of \SI{7.91}{\milli\meter} is manufactured by the Automotive Energy
        Supply Corporation~\cite{aesccell} while a \SI{63}{\amphour} pouch cell with
        a pouch height of \SI{11.0}{\milli\meter} is available from Kokam
        Inc.~\cite{Kokam60ahcell}. Therefore, it is reasonable to use a value of
        \SI{10.0}{\milli\meter} for this \SI{60}{\amphour} reference cell. As
        per  the assumptions discussed  in  \cref{subsec:layeroptassumptions}, 
        this  value  is  held constant throughout the layer optimisation
        process.

    \item \hypertarget{stackthickness}{\textbf{Computation of stack thickness of reference cell}}

        % In a  pouch of given height,  the available space to  accommodate layers
        % therein is restricted  by a number of factors. For  instance, the wiring
        % from the  current collectors  to the tabs and  protective elements  such
        % as fuses  etc.\ consume  physical  space. Furthermore,  
        
        The pouch 
        material itself has a  finite thickness (a value of
        \SI{160}{\milli\meter} is used here; see table note $g$ for this
        entry in \cref{tbl:lcoSimParamslayeropt}) and hence after accounting 
        for this, the stack thickness  available for placement of unit cells is
        smaller than  the pouch thickness.
        \begin{align}
            \text{Stack thickness}, L_\text{stack} & = \text{Pouch height} - 2\times \text{pouch thickness} \\
                                                   & = H_\text{pouch} - 2 T_\text{pouch}                    \\
                                                   & = 10.0 - 2\times(\num{160e-3})                         \\
            L_\text{stack}                         & = \SI{9.68}{\milli\meter}
        \end{align}
        The computed  value of stack  thickness is  held constant for  all layer
        choices trialled in the entire layer optimisation process.

    \item \textbf{Determination of number  of layers within  reference cell}

        The  next  step  is  to  determine  the  number  of  layers  within  the
        reference pouch  cell~$n_\text{refcell}$. The  thickness of  a complete
        electrochemical sandwich multiplied  by the number of  layers yields the
        total stack height
        \begin{equation}\label{eq:stackheightrefcell}
            n_\text{refcell}\, \left(l_\text{Al} + l_\text{pos} + l_\text{sep} + l_\text{neg} + l_\text{Cu}\right) = L_\text{stack}
        \end{equation}

        The product of number of layers  and the thickness of an electrochemical
        sandwich  cannot exceed  the  overall stack  height.  This implies  that
        the  equality in  \cref{eq:stackheightrefcell} is  to be  changed to  an
        inequality, with  the upper bound of  the expression on the  \gls{lhs} of
        \cref{eq:stackheightrefcell} set to the stack height.
        \begin{align}
            n_\text{refcell}\, \left(l_\text{Al} + l_\text{pos} + l_\text{sep} + l_\text{neg} + l_\text{Cu}\right) & \le L_\text{stack} \\
            n_\text{refcell}                                                                            & \le \frac{L_\text{stack}}{l_\text{Al} + l_\text{pos} + l_\text{sep} + l_\text{neg} + l_\text{Cu}}\label{eq:stackheightrefcellmod}
        \end{align}

        Since fractional layers do not have  any physical meaning, the number of
        layers that  can be  accommodated within  any pouch  must be  an integer
        quantity. Therefore,  $n_\text{refcell}$~is  computed as the  `floor' of
        the quantity in the \gls{rhs} of \cref{eq:stackheightrefcellmod}
        \begin{align}
            n_\text{refcell} &= \floor*{\frac{L_\text{stack}}{l_\text{Al} + l_\text{pos} + l_\text{sep} + l_\text{neg} + l_\text{Cu}}} \\
            {} &= \floor*{\frac{9.68}{(15 +  72 + 25 + 88 + 10) \times 10^{-3}}} \\
            n_\text{refcell} &= 46
        \end{align}
        The reference cell is thus determined to consist of 46~layers.

    \item \textbf{Computation of surface area per layer}

        Substituting  the values  of~$n_\text{refcell}$ and  $A_\text{refcell}$
        into  \cref{eq:overallarea}, the  electrochemically active  surface area
        per layer is obtained as
        \begin{align}
            A_\text{elec} & = \frac{A_\text{refcell}}{n_\text{refcell}} \\
            {}            & = \frac{\SI{2.053e6}{\meter\squared}}{46}     \\
            {}            & = \SI{44630.43}{\milli\meter\squared}\\
            A_\text{elec} & = \SI{44.63e-3}{\meter\squared} 
        \end{align}

        The   surface   area   per   layer    thus   computed   is   listed   in
        \cref{tbl:lcoSimParamslayeropt} and  is held  constant across  all layer
        choices  tried during  the layer  optimisation process.  This assumption
        is  immediately  justifiable  from   a  physical  viewpoint,  since  the
        process  of assembling  layers is  performed along  the axial  thickness
        direction (aligned with  pouch height) and is independent  of the planar
        (cross-sectional) direction.

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Modification of standard \glsfmtshort{dfn} model to handle power inputs}\label{sec:innatepowerinput}

As   discussed  in   \cref{sec:packlevelhierarchy},   assuming  identical   cell
conditions during operation necessitates that the external stimulus to each cell
is an applied power value. The cell's terminal voltage and current can be viewed
as its  natural response  to this  power input. To  simulate this  condition and
achieve a model-based optimal layer  design, the standard \gls{dfn} model, which
conventionally handles  current stimuli, has  to be suitably modified  to accept
power inputs.

Plett~\cite{Plett2016}  suggests  a methodology  for  applying  power inputs  to
equivalent circuit models  for simulation at a fixed sample  rate. This involves
converting the input  power~$P_k$ to a current~$I_k$ using  an equivalent series
resistance~$R_0$. The  value of~$R_0$ is  updated at each time  index~$k$ as per
\cref{eq:PlettPower}.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:PlettPower}
    I_k = \frac{v_k - \sqrt{v^\text{2}_k - 4R_0P_{k}}}{2R_0}
\end{equation}
where $v_k$~is the  cell's terminal voltage at time index  $k$, evolved from the
applied current up to and including the $(k-1)^\text{th}$~time step.

There  are  two disadvantages  in  using  Plett's  simplified approach  for  the
proposed layer optimisation study. Firstly, this necessitates the quantification
of  a  lumped  electrical  resistance  for  a \gls{pbm}.  Such  an  idea  is  at
loggerheads  with the  fundamental  philosophy of  \glspl{pbm}  which strive  to
represent  a  detailed  picture  of  underlying phenomena,  as  opposed  to  the
system-level terminal  behavioural characterisation facilitated  by \glspl{ecm}.
Translating  power  to current  in  this  manner  also necessitates  a  two-pass
conversion between the  physical and electrical domains --- a  process likely to
significantly degrade modelling fidelity. Since  the results from application of
the model  shall inform the  number of  layers to be  used in a  real-world cell
design, such loss of fidelity is unacceptable. Secondly, the constraint of using
fixed interval updates  implies that a high-speed  adaptive time-stepping solver
cannot be used for handling this power input condition. This shall slow down the
simulation speed considerably since the search space of layer combinations to be
considered is  fairly large.  Furthermore, the simulations  have to  be repeated
over  multiple combinations  of  initial and  ambient  temperatures which  shall
significantly  slow  down the  model-based  design  simulations and  offset  its
advantages over a conventional prototype-based design.

Dees~\etal~\cite{Dees2002}  identified the  requirement  of  having a  \gls{p2d}
model that  can run on applied  power. However, in the  aforementioned work, the
relevant equations for reformulation of  solid-phase boundary conditions are not
presented. An  independent derivation  of reformulating  the \gls{p2d}  model to
facilitate  an  innate  power  input capability  is  therefore  provided.  Since
the  equations  are  derived  for  a single  layer,  the  power  \emph{density},
obtained by  dividing the  applied power by  the overall  active cross-sectional
area~$A_\text{cell}$, is used as the driving input.

In  the  \gls{p2d}  model,  charge  conservation in  solid  phase  is  given  by
\cref{eq:solidchargeconserve},  which is  revisited  below.  
\Crefrange{eq:solidchargeconservecurrBC}{eq:solidchargeconservezeroBC} represent
the corresponding  boundary conditions. In these equations, the current
density~$i$ represents the applied input, $\sigma_\text{eff}$~the effective
electronic conductivity and $a_\text{s}$~the specific interfacial surface area
of an electrode respectively, $j\, $~the molar flux density of lithium at the
electrode surface and $\phi_\text{s}$ the solid phase potential.
\begin{align}
    \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \left(\sigma_{\text{eff}} \frac{\partial \phi_\text{s}(x,t)}{\partial x} \right) &= a_\text{s} F j(x,t) \tag{\cref{eq:solidchargeconserve} revisited}\\
    \sigma_{\text{eff}} \frac{\partial \phi_\text{s}(x,t)}{\partial x} \bigg|_{\mathrlap{\substack{x_\text{pos/Alcc}\\x_\text{neg/Cucc}}}} \qquad &= -i\label{eq:solidchargeconservecurrBC}\\
    \sigma_{\text{eff}} \frac{\partial \phi_\text{s}(x,t)}{\partial x} \bigg|_{\mathrlap{\substack{x_\text{pos/sep}\\x_\text{neg/sep}}}} \qquad &= 0\label{eq:solidchargeconservezeroBC}
\end{align}

\Cref{eq:undiscretisedPhiSpowerBC}   replaces   the    boundary   condition   in
\cref{eq:solidchargeconservecurrBC}  to use  the  applied  power density~$p$  to
drive the model.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:undiscretisedPhiSpowerBC}
    \sigma_{\text{eff}_\text{neg}} \left( \phi_\text{s}(x,t) \frac{\partial
            \phi_\text{s}(x,t)}{\partial
x}\right)\Bigg\rvert_{\mathrlap{x=x_\text{neg/Cucc}}}  -
        \sigma_{\text{eff}_\text{pos}} \left( \phi_\text{s}(x,t) \frac{\partial \phi_\text{s}(x,t)}{\partial x} \right)\Bigg\rvert_{\mathrlap{x=x_\text{pos/Alcc}}} = p
    \end{equation}

    \Crefrange{eq:ctspowerconstraint}{eq:cellpositivity}  represent constraints
    pertaining to physical laws and are to be satisfied.
    \begin{align}
	    vi  - p & = 0 \label{eq:ctspowerconstraint} \\
	    v       & > 0 \label{eq:cellpositivity}
    \end{align}
    \Cref{eq:ctspowerconstraint}  conveys  the  condition that  the  product  of
    the  terminal  voltage   and  computed  current  density   shall  equal  the
    externally applied  power density, whereas  \cref{eq:cellpositivity} implies
    that  the  cell's  terminal  voltage shall  always  remain  positive  during
    operation.   \Crefrange{eq:undiscretisedPhiSpowerBC}{eq:cellpositivity}  are
    then discretised for numerical implementation as follows.

    \Cref{fig:1d_fv_mesh} describes  a schematic  overview of  a one-dimensional
    cell-centred \gls{fv}  discretisation scheme. Here, evenly  spaced nodes are
    considered to form the support mesh along the through-thickness dimension of
    a  layer.  Vertical  lines  denote  the edges  of  control  volumes  whereas
    the  filled circles  depict  computational nodes  where the  axial-direction
    variables from \cref{tbl:dfneqns} are solved.

        Torchio~\etal~\cite{Torchio2016}.}
        \label{fig:1d_fv_mesh}
    \end{figure}

    \Cref{eq:discretisedPhiS}      represents     the      weak     form      of
    \cref{eq:solidchargeconserve}  applied   on  the  \gls{fv}  mesh   for  each
    control  volume, wherein  subscripts~$k$  and~$k\pm\frac{1}{2}$ denote  the
    $k$\textsuperscript{th}  \gls{fv} node  and  its associated  left and  right
    edges respectively.
    \begin{equation} \label{eq:discretisedPhiS}
        \sigma_{\text{eff}} \frac{\partial \phi_\text{s}(x,t)}{\partial x}\Bigg|_{x_{k-\frac{1}{2}}}^{x_{k+\frac{1}{2}}} = a_\text{s} F j_k(t) \Delta x
    \end{equation}

    At this juncture, a simplifying approximation for the solid-phase potentials
    can be considered.  In the standard \gls{fv} scheme, the  solution values at
    the faces (edges  of control volumes) is obtained by  interpolating from the
    two nearest \gls{fv} node values.  At either extrema of this one-dimensional
    computational  domain,  a  linear  extrapolation  of  the  values  from  the
    first  and last  nodes  can be  performed. This  increases  the accuracy  of
    computations, thereby  providing good estimates  of solid potentials  at the
    two current collector interfaces. However, with the increased fidelity comes
    the  penalty  of  a  mathematically  complex  set  of  boundary  conditions.
    When  using high  node  densities  in the  negative  and positive  electrode
    regions (see \cref{tbl:lcoSimParamslayeropt}), for the two outermost control
    volumes, the values of~$\frac{\Delta x}{2}$ become small. With a reasonably
    small mesh interval, the potentials at the cell centres can be considered to
    be nearly equal to that at their corresponding current collector interfaces.
    This  assumption  helps  to  keep  the  resulting  mathematical  expressions
    tractable.

    Applying    \cref{eq:discretisedPhiS}    to    the    first    control    volume
    (0\textsuperscript{th} node) in  the positive electrode and to  the last control
    volume (n\textsuperscript{th} node) in the negative electrode,
    \begin{align}
	    \frac{-\sigma_{\text{eff}_\text{pos}} \phi_{\text{s}_0}}{\Delta x_\text{pos}} + \frac{\sigma_{\text{eff}_\text{pos}} \phi_{\text{s}_1}}{\Delta x_\text{pos}} + i &= a_{\text{s}_\text{pos}} F j_0 \Delta x_\text{pos}\label{eq:PhiSappliedBCpos}\\
	    \frac{-\sigma_{\text{eff}_\text{neg}} \phi_{\text{s}_n}}{\Delta x_\text{neg}} + \frac{\sigma_{\text{eff}_\text{neg}} \phi_{\text{s}_{n-1}}}{\Delta x_\text{neg}} - i &= a_{\text{s}_\text{neg}} F j_n \Delta x_\text{neg}\label{eq:PhiSappliedBCneg}
    \end{align}

    Multiplying    \cref{eq:PhiSappliedBCpos}    by~$\phi_{\text{s}_0}$    and
    \cref{eq:PhiSappliedBCneg} by~$\phi_{\text{s}_n}$ and subtracting,
    \begin{multline} \label{eq:pinputBCcomplete}
        \frac{-\sigma_{\text{eff}_\text{pos}} \phi^2_{\text{s}_0}}{\Delta x_\text{pos}} -
        \frac{\sigma_{\text{eff}_\text{neg}} \phi^2_{\text{s}_n}}{\Delta x_\text{neg}} +
        \frac{\sigma_{\text{eff}_\text{pos}} \phi_{\text{s}_0} \phi_{\text{s}_1}}{\Delta x_\text{pos}} +
        \frac{\sigma_{\text{eff}_\text{neg}} \phi_{\text{s}_n} \phi_{\text{s}_{n-1}}}{\Delta x_\text{neg}} \\+ p -
        a_{\text{s}_\text{pos}} F j_0 x_\text{pos} \phi_{\text{s}_0} - a_{\text{s}_\text{neg}} F j_n x_\text{neg}
        \phi_{\text{s}_n} = 0
    \end{multline}

    % \fxnote{figure showing power input}

    Two     solutions     exist     for    the     quadratic     equation     in
    \cref{eq:pinputBCcomplete}.  However, the  solid  phase  potential, being  a
    physical quantity of the cell, has a unique solution. Therefore, in order to
    achieve  numerical convergence,  an  additional  positivity constraint,  the
    \gls{fv}-discretised equivalent of \cref{eq:cellpositivity}, is imposed.
    \begin{equation}\label{eq:discpositivity}
	    \phi_{\text{s}_0} - \phi_{\text{s}_n} > 0
    \end{equation}
    Finally,   since   the  input   to   the   model   is  the   applied   power
    density~$p$,  the  current  density  within  each  layer~$i$,  needs  to  be
    solved  for.  This   is  facilitated  by  employing   the  discretised  form
    of  \cref{eq:ctspowerconstraint}.   Furthermore,  since  this   equation  is
    mathematically simple, the aforementioned assumption of using node values at
    current  collector  interfaces is  no  longer  required. Applying  a  linear
    extrapolation  scheme  at  the  outermost  control  volumes,  the  algebraic
    residual equation is obtained as
    \begin{equation}\label{eq:currdensityresidual}
        0 = i - \frac{p}{1.5 \phi_{\mathrm{s}_0} - 0.5 \phi_{\mathrm{s}_1} + 0.5 \phi_{\mathrm{s}_{n-1}} - 1.5 \phi_{\mathrm{s}_{n-1}}}
    \end{equation}
    The    computer    code    used    (LIONSIMBA~v2.0,    to    be    discussed
    in    \cref{sec:platformlionsimba})    employs    the    \gls{dae}    solver
    IDA~\cite{sundials2005} to handle such algebraic constraints.

    \Crefrange{eq:pinputBCcomplete}{eq:currdensityresidual} therefore represents
    the discretised form  of the reformulated boundary  condition and associated
    algebraic constraints  for the solid  phase potential \gls{pde} that  can be
    applied to either electrode to facilitate  the use of an input power density
    to the \gls{p2d} model.

    \subsection{Hybrid spectral-\glsfmtshort{fv} scheme}\label{sec:hybridfv-spectral}

    Fast  and accurate  estimation  of the  solid  phase lithium  concentration,
    particularly  its  value  at  the  surface  of  electrode  particles  is  an
    inherent  requirement  of  the  layer optimisation  procedure  presented  in
    \cref{sec:layeroptframework}.  The  high  power  densities  to  be  handled,
    particularly  at  low layer  counts  necessitate  this requirement.  It  has
    been  acknowledged  that  solid-phase concentration  calculations  employing
    polynomial   approximations   lack   fidelity   at   high   charge/discharge
    rates~\cite{Santhanagopalan2006}. Hence, a  conventional full-order solution
    based on  Fick's law of  diffusion is  required for this  layer optimisation
    task.

    With full-order solid phase diffusion dynamics, applying the \gls{fv} scheme
    (that has been employed in LIONSIMBA~v1.0x (see \cref{sec:platformlionsimba}
    for   a  discussion   of  this   modelling  platform)   to  discretise   all
    through-thickness \glspl{pde} of the \gls{p2d} model) results in a very large
    system of equations. This  is due to the requirement of  using a high radial
    node density per spherical particle for improved accuracy. Consequently, the
    computational cost is  high and simulation run-time  becomes prohibitive when
    exploring the search  space of all possible  layer configurations. Moreover,
    with a cell-centered \gls{fv} discretisation,  it is non-trivial to directly
    apply  the ionic  flux boundary  condition  at the  particle surface,  since
    this  involves  extrapolation from  at  least  two  other nodes  within  the
    particle. While  such extrapolations are  acceptable in the  axial dimension
    ---  particularly  with  high  node  densities  providing  small  values  of~$\frac{\Delta x}{2}$ --- they are  undesirable in the radial dimension. This
    is because the cell's \gls{ocp} and terminal voltage strongly depends on the
    concentration at the particle surface.  Spectral methods offer a combination
    of  high accuracy  and speed  while  permitting the  use of  a lower  number
    of  radial  discretisation  nodes.  To  implement a  spectral  scheme  on  a
    non-periodic domain, a  Chebyshev discretisation~\cite{Trefethen2000} may be
    applied. Bizeray~\etal{}~\cite{Bizeray2015} discretised all of the \gls{p2d}
    model equations using this approach.  However, this entails a bi-directional
    mapping of all  field variables between the physical  and Chebyshev domains,
    incurring computational overhead.

    For the proposed layer optimisation simulations, a hybrid formulation of the
    \gls{p2d} model is proposed wherein a  standard \gls{fv} scheme in the axial
    dimension and  a spectral scheme in  the radial domain are  used. Exploiting
    this natural separation of the axial and radial domains enables to ---
    \begin{enumerate*}[label=\roman*)]
        \item retain  the   ability  to  easily   couple  the   molar  flux  density   at  the particle  surface  through  reformulation  of the  boundary  conditions  of  the solid  diffusion \gls{pde},  and
        \item solve  for  solid-phase  lithium  concentration  in  the  Chebyshev  domain  and locally transform  to physical  domain, without requiring  system-wide Chebyshev reformulations.
    \end{enumerate*}
    Although  the  proposed  implementation   does  not  \emph{globally}  employ
    a  spectral  scheme,  the   combined  beneficial  effects  of  radial-domain
    spectral   scheme  and   automatic  differentiation   of  system   equations
    using  CasADi~\cite{Andersson2013b} facilitate  rapid simulations,  enabling
    the   completion  of   the   layer  optimisation   in   a  short   duration.
    \Crefrange{eq:defineChebNodes}{eq:solidDiffEqChebDomain}  detail  the  steps
    leading  up to  the reformulated  solid phase  diffusion and  its associated
    boundary conditions in the Chebyshev domain.

    The $N_\text{r}$~Chebyshev   collocation  nodes,  defined  on   a  1D  mesh
    in   the   radial   direction,  are   given   by   \cref{eq:defineChebNodes}
    (see~\cite{Trefethen2000}).
    \begin{equation}\label{eq:defineChebNodes}
        \widetilde{r} = \cos\left(\frac{i\pi}{N_\text{r}}\right), \qquad i = 0, 1, \dots N_\text{r} \quad \widetilde{r} \in [-1, 1]
    \end{equation}
    Assuming constant diffusivity, expanding the derivative in the standard form
    of the Fickian spherical diffusion equation (see \cref{eq:dfnsoliddiff}) for
    each particle, we obtain  \cref{eq:quotientappliedpde}, presented along with
    its Neumann  boundary conditions, eqs.~\eqref{eq:quotientappliedpdeBCcentre}
    and~\eqref{eq:quotientappliedpdeBCsurface}.  $j$~is the  molar flux  density
    (\si{mol.m^{-2}.s^{-1}}) and $R_\text{p}$~is the particle radius (\si{m}).

    During  the  iterative solution  process,  the  spatial gradients  of  solid
    phase  lithium  concentration  in  \cref{eq:solidDiffEqChebDomain}  in  this
    case  are  not  computed   through  an  explicit  differentiation  procedure
    as  usual,  but  instead  evaluated  by  pre-multiplying  the  concentration
    values  at the  collocation  nodes by  a  Chebyshev differentiation  matrix.
    This  particular  aspect  is  responsible  for  the  inherent  reduction  of
    simulation  run-time  achieved  by  introducing a  spectral  method.  In  the
    updated  version  of LIONSIMBA~v2.0  (created  specifically  for this  layer
    optimisation work; see \cref{sec:platformlionsimba}  for a brief overview of
    the  modelling platform),  differentiation matrices  of suitable  dimensions
    as  well  as  the  Chebyshev  collocation  nodes  are  generated  using  the
    MATLAB  function   \texttt{cheb.m}  distributed  along  with   the  book  by
    Trefethen~\cite{Trefethen2000}.
