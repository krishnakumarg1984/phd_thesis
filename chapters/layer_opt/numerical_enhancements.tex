\subsection{Augmentation of parameters to standard \glsfmtshort{dfn} model}

\subsubsection*{Cell capacity and electrochemically active surface area}

The  \gls{p2d} implementation  of  the standard  \gls{dfn}  model lacks  certain
parameters that are vital to the  layer optimisation process. The cell's nominal
capacity is a fundamental quantity that gets  altered as the number of layers is
varied. However, it may be surprising  to discover that this parameter is absent
in present  research literature  discussing the  \gls{p2d} model.  The rationale
behind this glaring omission becomes clear  upon closer examination of the model
equations presented in  \cref{tbl:dfneqns}. These equations do not  operate on a
cell level, but  instead operate on a  normalised basis \ie{} only  one layer is
modelled on a  \emph{unit area} basis wherein the stimulus  driving the model is
the applied current  \emph{density} rather than the total  external current. The
layer  optimisation task  here faces  a unique  predicament of  adhering to  the
present modelling paradigm  to retain compatibility with  standard models whilst
still incorporating  the concept of cell's  capacity as a function  of number of
layers.

To  tackle the  aforementioned quandary,  it  is key  to realise  that the  core
parameter  that  varies with  the  number  of layers  in  a  pouch cell  is  the
\emph{electrochemically  active  cross-sectional surface  area}~$A_\text{cell}$.
Curiously, published  literature on  physics-based cell  modelling do  not place
rigorous emphasis on  this key parameter. Most often, to  this author's chagrin,
this  parameter is  simply  listed in  a  standard table  of  parameters and  is
typically  sourced from  a historic  parameter-set with  no further  explanation
provided.

For  a pouch  cell, the  overall electrochemically  active surface  area can  be
defined as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:overallarea}
    A_\text{cell} = n \times A_\text{elec}
\end{equation}
where $n$ is  the number of layers and $A_\text{elec}$  is the electrochemically
active surface area per layer.

\subsubsection*{Surface area per layer}\label{sec:surfareaperlayer}

A literature search reveals that akin  to cell capacity, there is no information
of  cross-sectional geometry  provided in  articles dealing  with the  \gls{p2d}
implementation of  the \gls{dfn} model. To  determine the surface area  per face
(per layer), the author proposes  a new methodology/process involving a sequence
of  steps, based  on  certain  assumptions and  literature  search. The  process
involves  selection of  a  real-world cell,  and ultimately  mapping  it to  the
surface area per  unit face. To the  best knowledge of the  author, this reverse
parametrisation process,  mapping from  a real-world cell  to a  \gls{p2d} model
parameter  is unique  and is  claimed  as a  contribution  to the  art which  is
explained next.

    \item \hypertarget{refcellselection}{\textbf{Selection of a suitable reference capacity cell}}

        Although  this value  shall not  be used  in the  actual layer  optimisation
        procedure itself, this is a  crucial first-step towards obtaining a complete
        parameter set, in particular, to obtain the surface area per layer.

        The focus  of this chapter is  to provide ready-to-use solution  to industry
        extend  with the  aim of  improving  the current  state of  the art  through
        optimal layer configuration  of pouch cells. There is a  clear motivation to
        further increase  cell capacities so as  to maximize driving range,  as laid
        out in the beginning of this chapter (see \cref{sec:layeroptintro}).

        With  this  guiding  principle,  as  a starting  point  towards  choosing  a
        reference capacity cell,  a survey was performed to  identify the production
        \gls{bev}  with  the  highest  driving  range.  As  of  2018,~the  Chevrolet
        Bolt~\gls{bev} bears this distinction  with a range of \SI{383}{\kilo\meter}
        as rated  by the  United States Environmental  Protection Agency  (EPA). The
        specifications of  its battery pack is  listed in Liu~\etal~\cite{Liu2016a}.
        The  battery pack  of  this  vehicle consists  of  288~cells  arranged in  a
        96S-3P configuration, in  agreement with the configuration  discussed in the
        drivetrain  hierarchy  of  \cref{sec:packlevelhierarchy}.

        The    Chevrolet   Bolt    \gls{bev}   pack    has   an    energy   capacity
        of   \SI{60.0}{\kilo\watthour}    with   a    nominal   pack    voltage   of
        \SI{350}{\volt}~\cite{Liu2016a}.  However,  for   this  specific  task,  the
        \si{\amphour} capacity is required. This can be obtained
        \begin{align}
            \text{\si{\amphour} capacity of Bolt cell} & = \frac{\text{Pack Energy } (\si{\watthour})}{\text{Nominal pack voltage (V)} \times {\text{Number of cells in parallel}}} \\
            {}                                         & = \frac{60000}{350 \times 3} \\
            {}                                         & = \SI{57.14}{\amphour}
        \end{align}

        \begin{itemize}[ leftmargin=10pt, itemindent=15pt, labelwidth=5pt, labelsep=5pt, listparindent=0.7cm, align=left]
            \item \textbf{DC bus voltage and revised cell capacity}

                Even  without  a  dc/dc  boost   converter,  robust  design  of  the
                powertrain during  brown-outs should  allow for  continued operation
                even   with   a  slightly   diminished   DC   bus  voltage   \approx
                \SIrange{4}{5}{\percent} lower than nominal~\cite{Maksimovic2012}.
                Considering a maximum permissible dip of \SI{4}{\percent} in the bus
                voltage \ie{} \SI{336}{\volt}, the cell's capacity may be refined as
                \begin{align}
                    \text{\si{\amphour} capacity of Bolt cell} & = \frac{\text{Pack Energy } (\si{\watthour})}{\text{Lowest pack voltage (V)} \times {\text{Number of cells in parallel}}} \\
                    {}                                         & = \frac{60000}{336 \times 3} \\
                    {}                                         & = \SI{59.52}{\amphour}
                \end{align}

                The reference cell's \si{\amphour} capacity is therefore rounded to
                \textbf{\SI{60}{\amphour}}\footnote{In the interest of maintaining consistency, this computed capacity is
                    retained for the cell used in
                    \crefrange{ch:spmanalysis}{ch:newelectrolytemodel} of this thesis. This also explains the use of \SI{60}{\ampere} for
                    the simulations demonstrating energy/power trade-off of
                    \cref{sec:energypowertradeoffdemo} since this current level corresponds to
                the 1C-rate of the cell.}.

            \item \hypertarget{celllowercutoff}{\textbf{Lower cutoff voltage for cells}}

                In  this  layer  optimisation  work, following  the  assumptions  of
                \cref{subsec:layeroptassumptions},  the  overall pack  configuration
                remains  unchanged  and  independent   of  layers  within  a  pouch.
                This  implies that  the undervoltage  threshold for  DC bus  voltage
                throughout  this   work  shall  remain  fixed   at  \SI{336}{\volt}.
                Therefore, with  96~series connected  cells in  a string,  the lower
                cut-off voltage for an  individual cell is \textbf{\SI{3.5}{\volt}}.
                This  value is  reported in  \cref{tbl:lcoSimParamslayeropt} and  is
                used as a termination condition  for all simulations as explained in
                \cref{sec:layeroptframework}.

        \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Computing electrochemically active surface area for reference cell}

        For             the            cell             properties            in
        \crefrange{tbl:lcoSimParamsSPMp2d}{tbl:lcoSimParamslayeropt},        the
        majority                of                 parameters                are
        sourced           from          Subramanian~\etal~\cite{Subramanian2009}
        and                Northrop~\etal~\cite{Northrop2011}.                In
        Northrop~\etal~\cite{Northrop2011},  the   \emph{current  density}  that
        corresponds to  a 1C-rate discharge  of a  cell with this  parameter set
        is  reported to  be \approx  \SI{30}{\ampere\per\meter\squared}. In  the
        author's carefully  designed numerical simulations (very  slow discharge
        at C/500 from fully charged state until charge depletion), this value is
        refined to \SI{29.23}{\ampere\per\meter\squared}.

        The task of determining the electrochemically active overall surface
        area of the reference cell is now straightforward
        \begin{align}
            \text{Overall surface area of reference cell}, A_\text{refcell} &= \frac{\text{Cell capacity (\si{\amphour})}}{\text{1C-rate density (\si{\ampere\per\meter\squared})}} \\
                                                                            &= \frac{60}{29.23} \\
                                                                            &= \SI{2.053}{\meter\squared}
        \end{align}

        This  value  is  listed  in  \cref{tbl:lcoSimParamsSPMp2d}  for  use  in
        \crefrange{ch:spmanalysis}{ch:newelectrolytemodel},  but  is  \emph{not}
        used  in  this  layer  optimisation   work.  This  is  because,  as  the
        number  of  layers change,  the  overall  surface  area changes  as  per
        \cref{eq:overallarea}.

    \item \textbf{Pouch height of reference cell}

        Although the  official press release~\cite{GMBoltBatteryDims}  from the
        manufacturer  of this  \gls{bev} contains  data on  the cross-sectional
        geometry  of the  cell,  it does  not report  its  height. Hence,  this
        information  needs to  be assumed  by extrapolation  from an  alternate
        source wherein the conditions are similar and therefore, can be applied
        for this reference cell.

        The  review   article  by   Gr\"oger~\etal~\cite{Groger2015}  discusses
        various    states    of    the    art   in    energy    densities    of
        electrode   materials  used   in  various   lithium  ion   chemistries.
        At   the   time   of   its   publication,   the   areal   capacity   of
        cells  were  \approx  \SI{2.0}{\milli\amphour\per\centi\meter\squared}.
        These    authors   recommended    an   areal    capacity   target    of
        \SI{4.0}{\milli\amphour\per\centi\meter\squared} for  future automotive
        applications. This  publication also  considers the aspect  of stacking
        layers  into  pouches  of  certain  geometries.  In  particular,  table
        \romanletter{4}  of Gr\"oger~\etal~\cite{Groger2015}  considers a  pouch
        of  \SI{10}{\milli\meter} height,  for which  the aforementioned  areal
        capacities were calculated.

        In       the        case       of       the        reference       cell
        under       consideration,       the      areal       capacity       is
        \begin{equation}
            \text{Areal capacity of reference cell } = \frac{\SI{60000}{\milli\amphour}}{\SI{20527}{\centi\meter\squared}}  = \SI{2.92}{\milli\amphour\per\centi\meter\squared}
        \end{equation}
        which is close  to the desired value in automotive  applications as per
        the recommendations  in Gr\"oger~\etal. Considering that  the reference
        cell is  drawn from  the high energy  density Chevrolet  Bolt \gls{bev}
        cell,  a pouch  height of  \SI{10}{\milli\meter} is  justifiable for
        this task  and is  reported in \cref{tbl:lcoSimParamslayeropt}.  As per
        the assumptions discussed in \cref{subsec:layeroptassumptions}, this is
        held constant throughout the layer optimisation process.

    \item \hypertarget{stackthickness}{\textbf{Compute stack thickness of reference cell}}

        In a  pouch of given height,  the available space to  accommodate layers
        therein is restricted  by a number of factors. For  instance, the wiring
        from the  current collectors  to the tabs,  protective elements  such as
        fuses etc.\ consume space. For instance, the pouch material itself has a
        finite  thickness  and  hence  after  accounting  for  this,  the  stack
        thickness  available  for  layer  placement  is  lower  than  the  pouch
        thickness.
        \begin{align}
            \text{Stack thickness}, L_\text{stack} & = \text{Pouch height} - 2\times \text{pouch thickness} \\
            \text{Stack thickness}, L_\text{stack} & = H_\text{pouch} - 2 T_\text{pouch} \\
            L_\text{stack}(\si{\milli\meter})      & = 10.0 - 2\times(\num{160e-3}) \\
            L_\text{stack}                         & = \SI{9.68}{\milli\meter}
        \end{align}

        The value of stack thickness of  the reference cell is held constant for
        all layer choices used throughout the entire layer optimisation process.

    \item \textbf{Integer  optimisation to  determine number  of layers within  reference cell}

        The  number of  layers that  can be  accommodated within  any pouch  must be  an
        integer quantity, since fractional layers do not have a physical meaning.
