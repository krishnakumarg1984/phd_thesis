\chapter[Model-based Design of Pouch Cells]{%
    Model-based  Design Of  Pouch Cells\footnote{\textbf{Attribution  of content}  \
        The  groundwork  for converting  the  existing  computer code  (LIONSIMBA~v1.0x)
        into  a suitable  form  for  layer optimisation  was  initiated  by this  thesis
        author, \mbox{Krishnakumar  Gopalakrishnan}. However, with the  exception of the
        spectral scheme,  for which \mbox{Krishnakumar Gopalakrishnan}  was responsible,
        and  the  zero-dimensional  thermal  model for  which  \mbox{Ian  D.\  Campbell}
        (PhD  student,  Imperial  College  London)  was  responsible,  the  advancements
        inherent to the  enhanced computer software (LIONSIMBA~v2.0) were  made in equal
        parts by  \mbox{Krishnakumar Gopalakrishnan} and \mbox{Ian  D.\ Campbell}. These
        advancements would not have been  possible without the contributions and support
        of \mbox{Dr.~Davide M.~Raimondo} (Associate  Professor, University of Pavia) who
        served as  an unofficial supervisor for  the work reported in  this chapter. The
        concept  of layer  reconfiguration for  energy  and power  trade-off, the  layer
        optimisation  framework,  and  the  source  code  by  which  it  is  implemented
        were  co-developed  in equal  parts  by  \mbox{Krishnakumar Gopalakrishnan}  and
        \mbox{Ian  D.\  Campbell}.  \mbox{Krishnakumar  Gopalakrishnan}  was  the  major
        contributor  to  the  development  of  the binary  search  while  \mbox{Ian  D.\
            Campbell} was the  major contributor in the analysis  of results. \mbox{Parvathy
        Chittur Subramanianprasad}  (MSc student, Queen  Mary University of  London) was
        instrumental in  developing the analytical  expression for the  maximum possible
    number of layers~$n_\text{max}$.}%

% \section{Conclusion}

% The outcome is that a ready to  use tool is made available to validate empirical
% layer choices.  In the  absence of  access to  cell manufacturing  facilities to
% confirm and test  the layer Immediate adoption  in industry, this is  the best I
% can do. Needs to be prototyped and tested.
