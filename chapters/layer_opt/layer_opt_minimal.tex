% \section[Introduction]{Introduction\protect\footnote{\textbf{Attribution      of
%         content}  \   The  groundwork   for  converting   the  existing   computer  code
%         (LIONSIMBA~v1.0$x$) into a suitable form for layer optimisation was initiated by
%         this  thesis  author,  \mbox{Krishnakumar  Gopalakrishnan}.  However,  with  the
%         exception of  the spectral scheme, for  which \mbox{Krishnakumar Gopalakrishnan}
%         was  responsible, and  the zero-dimensional  thermal model  for which  \mbox{Ian
%         Campbell} was  responsible, the advancements  inherent to the  enhanced computer
%         software  (LIONSIMBA~v2.0)  were  made  in  equal  parts  by  \mbox{Krishnakumar
%         Gopalakrishnan} and \mbox{Ian Campbell}. These  advancements would not have been
%         possible without the contributions and support of Dr.~Davide Raimondo who served
%         as an unofficial  supervisor for the work reported in  this chapter. The concept
%         of layer reconfiguration for energy  and power trade-off, the layer optimisation
%         framework, and the  source code by which it is  implemented were co-developed in
%         equal  parts  by  \mbox{Krishnakumar Gopalakrishnan}  and  \mbox{Ian  Campbell}.
%         \mbox{Krishnakumar Gopalakrishnan} was the  major contributor to the development
%         of the binary search while \mbox{Ian  Campbell} was the major contributor in the
%         analysis of results. \mbox{Parvathy  Chittur Subramanianprasad} was instrumental
%         in  developing the  analytical expression  for  the maximum  possible number  of
% layers~$n_\text{max}$.}}\label{sec:layeroptintro}

% \section{Conclusion}

% The outcome is that a ready to  use tool is made available to validate empirical
% layer choices.  In the  absence of  access to  cell manufacturing  facilities to
% confirm and test  the layer Immediate adoption  in industry, this is  the best I
% can do. Needs to be prototyped and tested.
