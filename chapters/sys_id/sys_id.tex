\section{Conclusions}

In  summary, while  the newly  developed composite  \gls{spm} is  not considered
robust for use in  sustained discharge at high C-rates, it  is indeed a suitable
option for  dynamic load profiles, even  for those with high  peak magnitudes of
instantaneous charge or discharge. Such  load profiles are typically encountered
in vehicular  applications, particularly  in hybrid  electric vehicles.  Thus, a
suitable time-domain \gls{rom} that can be directly implemented in discrete-time
has  been  developed  through  system   identification  and  its  strengths  and
weaknesses have been quantified. The applicability of this model has been proven
for real-life  scenarios using a  highly dynamic  load cycle. Thus,  this author
concludes that the  composite \gls{spm} developed here does  indeed represent an
advancement to  the present  modelling art. This  model may now  be used  as the
plant  model  in  state  estimation  and control  applications  in  a  vehicular
\gls{bms}. This concludes the chapter as  well as all the implementation aspects
of physics-based battery modelling discussed in this thesis.
