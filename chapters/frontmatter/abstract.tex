The  realisation of  \glspl{pbm}  of lithium  ion cells  in  the \glspl{bms}  of
electric  vehicles is  studied through  a three-pronged  strategy ---  analysis,
design  and  implementation.   The  survey  of  literature   undertaken  in  the
backdrop of  this broad landscape  reveals a  dearth of model-based  designs for
automotive-grade  pouch  cells,  which  is therefore  addressed  in  this  work.
Perusal of  prior art in  reduced-order battery modelling provides  key guidance
on  topics meriting  further  investigation \viz~the  \gls{dra}  scheme and  the
electrolyte-enhanced \gls{spm} which are  therefore carefully analysed here from
the perspective of  their embedded implementation. Owing to  its familiarity and
wide-spread popularity among relevant stakeholders, the \gls{p2d} implementation
of  the \gls{dfn}  model  is used  as the  \gls{pbm}  underpinning all  research
presented herein.
