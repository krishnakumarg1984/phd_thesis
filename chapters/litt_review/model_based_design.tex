In sharp contrast to the cornucopia of published literature dealing with reduced
order  modelling  of cells  (see  \cref{sec:classificationscheme}),  there is  a
relative paucity of prior art that discuss model-based cell design. This section
aims to critically evaluate this sparse pool of knowledge.

At  the  outset, it  is  important  to clarify  this  thesis  author's views  on
model-based design in general and why this topic was chosen as an aspect of this
thesis.  In  the  recent  decades,  industries  pertaining  to  different  walks
of  life,  cutting  across  any  one  discipline,  have  begun  to  establish  a
model-led product/process development culture. For instance, a broad overview of
industrial  research  policy by  Thomke~\cite{Thomke1998}  towards  the turn  of
the  last millennium  provides  quantifiable evidence  that  a simulation  based
design approach  in the  automotive industry  has had a  positive impact  in the
crash-worthiness of resulting  vehicular designs. At a high  level, the benefits
of any model-based design are ---
\begin{enumerate*}[label=\itshape\alph*\upshape)]
    \item reducing the number of design iterations thereby speeding up the time to a production-ready prototype, and
    \item improved understanding of the variables influencing design gained by formalising empirical/ad-hoc knowledge.
\end{enumerate*}
Finally, it is a well-known fact that, computer-time is cheaper than human time.
Therefore, with  a simulation-oriented design  approach, it is often  cheaper to
explore Monte~Carlo-like design scenarios  using a computer model than iterating
over  a  series  of  rudimentary  prototypes  in  the  lab.  Finally,  once  the
results  predicted by  the model  has stabilised  enough to  satisfy the  design
specifications,  prototyping can  be  attempted, thereby  reducing  the time  to
market.

The   aforementioned    views   of    the   thesis    author   is    echoed   by
Becker~\etal~\cite{Becker2005}  who  present  a   persuasive  view  that,  since
it  becomes  essential  to  have   a  deeper  understanding  of  the  simulation
tools  to successfully  employ a  model-led  design, this  can trigger  sweeping
changes percolating  into the  very core  of the  problem-solving culture  in an
organisation. Although relatively  at its infancy when it comes  to cell design,
model-based  designs have  been applied  at the  pack-level in  the past  and is
therefore not a  newcomer to the battery  industry in general. In  the middle of
the last  decade, a clarion  call to the industry  to adopt simulation  tools in
battery  engineering was  issued  by Spotnitz~\cite{Spotnitz2005}.  In the  said
article,  the author  questioned  the anachronistic  industry  trend of  relying
heavily on `making and testing' rather than aiming to understand the fundamental
governing equations  and principles  of a  battery and  using this  know-how for
design. Spotnitz~\cite{Spotnitz2005}  further argues  that using  \glspl{pbm} of
batteries could provide  reliable understanding of their behaviour,  and that as
the  understanding of  the  community steadily  grows, it  could  bring about  a
significant speed-up of battery development.

The nature and  scope of `model-based design' as intended  by this thesis author
needs to  be clarified. Since  this thesis focuses exclusively  on physics-based
modelling, the term  `model' pertains to \glsfirst{pbm}s and  not \glspl{ecm} or
any  other type  of  battery  models (such  as  other empirical/ad-hoc  models).
Therefore, the  survey of literature  here does  not include any  design efforts
outside of this scope.

There is  evidence that  computational modelling has  been successfully  used to
facilitate the development of novel energy storage materials. The review article
by Islam and Fisher~\cite{Islam2014} provides an overview of the use of computer
simulation  into gaining  a deeper  insight  into the  working of  new types  of
cathode  materials. Meng  and Arroyo-de~Domp~\cite{Meng2009}  also surveyed  the
topic  of using  computational tools  for  ``design and  optimisation of  energy
storage materials. The computer models referred  to in these review articles are
not volume-averaged models  operating at the cell-level,  but detailed ab-initio
models  constructed using  techniques such  as Density  Functional Theory~(DFT).
While  it is  heartening  to  see such  comprehensive  studies of  computational
techniques applied to energy storage, there are two distinct reasons why the art
reviewed therein does not  align with the goals of this  thesis. Firstly, in the
works  reviewed in  the  aforementioned articles,  computer  simulation is  used
primarily  to facilitate  researchers' understanding  that can  help to  develop
the  next generation  of energy  storage components.  The computational  methods
presented  therein are  \emph{not}  employed as  design  tools. Secondly,  these
articles use computational modelling to  study structural properties at the meso
and nano scales. While these are of utmost importance to researchers involved in
synthesising prototypes of next generation of energy storage materials, they are
not applicable for production-ready cell-designs at scale. Since this thesis has
a  strong  focus on  providing  readily  applicable  solutions to  industry  for
incumbent lithium  ion chemistries, this thesis  author chose not to  pursue the
methods discussed in  the aforementioned works for the  design studies discussed
here.

A    holistic   computational    structure    screening    was   performed    by
Sendek~\etal~\cite{Sendek2017}  to  study  the  suitability  of  12831~candidate
materials for their suitability as  solid state electrolytes. The same rationale
presented  by  this thesis  author  \ie{}  rapid  prototyping  is cited  as  the
motivation behind  this study undertaken  by the authors  of the said  work. The
study  helped to  narrow down  the viable  family structures  to 21.  This study
serves as the first concrete example  in this literature survey wherein computer
simulation is  directly used as  a design tool for  components of a  lithium ion
cell. The  scope of  this work falls  into the realm  of material  synthesis and
applied  physics ---  topics outside  the educational  background and  expertise
of  this  thesis  author.  Nevertheless,  the success  of  this  study  strongly
motivates  the case  for  performing  a computational  study  of similar  scale.
Instead of  screening out thousands  of candidate materials, the  work presented
in  \cref{ch:modelbaseddesign} computationally  screens out  thousands of  layer
configurations within a pouch cell and provides a simulation-based design tool.

Curiously,  the use  of volume-averaged  models  for design  simulations at  the
cell-scale \glspl{pbm}  has not  yet gained traction  despite the  prevalence of
the  popular  \gls{p2d}  implementation  of  the  \gls{dfn}  model  in  academia
for   applications   such   as  degradation   analysis   and   state-estimation.
Ramadesigan~\etal~\cite{Ramadesigan2012} postulate that this could be attributed
to the computational challenges presented by the complex reaction, diffusion and
kinetics  of lithium  ion batteries  occurring  over different  length and  time
scales.

For design  problems at the  pack-level, such  as for thermal  management design
optimisation, tools such as Battery  Design Studio (Cd-adapco), Star-CCM+, ANSYS
Fluent and COMSOL's Batteries \& Fuel Cells Module have been used in
