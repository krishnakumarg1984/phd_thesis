\capolettera{T}{his} chapter discusses the state of the  art in the field of lithium ion battery
modelling that is pertinent to the research sub-topics discussed in this thesis.
Consequently,  the modelling  art  is presented  in two  parts,  with each  part
providing a critical review of
\begin{enumerate}[topsep=0pt, before={\vspace*{-0.25\baselineskip}}]
    \item the body of literature pertinent to model-based design of lithium ion cells.
    \item the prior works dealing with the analysis and implementation aspects of \glspl{rom} of lithium ion cells.
\end{enumerate}
