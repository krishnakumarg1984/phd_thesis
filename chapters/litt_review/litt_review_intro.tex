\capolettera{T}{his} chapter  discusses the  state of  the art  in the  field of
lithium ion battery modelling pertinent  to the research sub-topics discussed in
this thesis.   The modelling  art is  therefore presented in three  parts, each
providing a critical review of

    \item the body of literature discussing model-based design of lithium ion cells.
    \item prior works dealing with the analysis and implementation aspects
        of reduced order modelling of lithium ion cells, whose revelations lead
        to a focus on
    \item publications discussing the \gls{spm} and its variants.
